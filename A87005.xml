            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Having obtained a Book (of yours) Intituled to me, although (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) never intended me (as by you) I thought good to peruſe it, and alſo to give an anſwer to it, although I might have better improved time, and ink, and paper, than to have anſwered ſuch a running kind of diſcourſe, the which hath out run both Scripture and ſound reaſon; but however truth hath overtaken it, and given it its deaths wound: and farther, this diſcourſe of yours hath engaged me to ſpeak more largely of the Doctrine of Election and Reprobation, and to ſhew how Gods Decree in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection depends upon Chriſt (<hi>viz.</hi>) to chuſe none to ſalvation and glory, but ſuch as are of Chriſts family either actively or paſſively; when I ſay actively, I mean ſuch as are in Chriſt through faith; and when I ſay paſſively, I mean all Infants that have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
<pb facs="tcp:118963:3"/>their happineſs by perſonal tranſgreſſion, for the Redemption is (a free gift, and is) as large as the tranſgreſſion; ſo that as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt the lives and bleſſing of all men, ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> (the LORD JESUS) purchaſed it again, ſo that none are damned (<hi>viz.</hi> taſte the ſecond death) but ſuch as deny the Lord that bought them, but all men muſt dye (the firſt death) or be changed, which is as death, for the firſt <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, and the very ſame all men are,

I have alſo ſhewed that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall return to their own Land, and that Chriſt ſhall be their King ſitting upon the Throne of <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> according to the letter of the Scriptures (the truth whereof is) witneſſed by the mouth of all the holy Prophets, and Evangeliſts, and Apoſtles; I have not given any interpretation upon the Prophets, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, or Apoſtles for theſe two reaſons; Firſt, becauſe no perſon might have any colour to wave what is written (as to that ſubject) ſeeing it is the pure minde and will of God, without the leaſt mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mans meaning and interpretation: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe my occaſion alſo would not admit of enlarging my ſelf upon it. And as touching your Ordination to the Miniſtery, I have examined and ſhewn that your Presbyter (by which you were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained) was not a lawfull one, nor you fitly qualified and alſo that no man may be appointed a Miniſter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

<pb facs="tcp:118963:4"/>may ſay) to a Miniſter, but I ever ſpake againſt it ſo as to deny it to be the efficient or ſuparlative cauſe of a Miniſter, and do ſay, that Chriſt aſcending up on high and leading captivity captive, and giving gifts to men, is that which makes a Miniſter, although learning may not be denyed to be a uſeful hand-maid, neither may ſuch be denyed to be Miniſters, whom Chriſt hath gifted to preach the Goſpel to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exhortation and comfort, although they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant of that humane edification of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge;</hi> and let me tell you (without offence) that I know none more ignorant in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Goſpel, than thoſe of your ſtamp (for the greateſt part of them) but I ſuppoſe the reaſon is, becauſe they aſcribe preheminence to that which ſhould be ſubordinate.

<pb facs="tcp:118963:5"/>been to receive mens doctrine without tryall, eſpecially when they have had a name to be great learned men, never conſidering the words of the Lord which ſaith, <hi>Not many wiſe or learned men hath he choſen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his hidden wiſdome to, but hath hid it from them and revealed it to Babes and ſucklings;</hi> and was it not Gods way to chuſe Heardſmen to be his Prophets, and Fiſhermen to be his Apoſtles, and in a word, ſuch as were accounted ignorant men, ſuch as knew little of the law, even ſuch God did chuſe to reveal his Son, in that none might glory in men; therefore take heed of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived upon ſuch account; but now prove thy ſelf to be like the men of <hi>Berea,</hi> the which were more noble than the men of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> becauſe they ſearched the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, to ſee whether thoſe things that was preached to them, were truth yea, or nay: therefore be exhorted for the time to come, to give all diligence, in caſes of weight, to try it by the Scriptures, and ſeek to the Lord to give thee underſtanding therein, and then doubtleſs thou ſhalt do well.</p>
            <p>I have opened the ninth Chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and when thou readeſt it, conſider that it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe touching the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that God was juſt in caſting them off for their ſins, although they were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſhewing, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of <hi>Abrahams</hi> lines, and <hi>Eſau</hi> of the lines of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and yet for their wickedneſs were rejected; and alſo <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that hardened himſelf againſt the Lord and his people, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, the Lord choſe his deluſion, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him up to hardneſs of heart, to make his Name known throughout all the earth, that all men might take warning by him: And as to that which is ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the return of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the houſe
<pb facs="tcp:118963:5"/>of <hi>Judah</hi> out of their captivity, and the Reign of Chriſt in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I deſire thee to weigh ſeriouſly, becauſe if thou underſtand it aright it will help thee much in the underſtanding of all the Scriptures (in a great meaſure) as <hi>Daniel, Zachary,</hi> and the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> when others will be found to turn the Scriptures into alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories, not knowing what they ſay, nor whereof they do affirm, being never able to keep the Scriptures in a harmony; it will alſo ſtrengthen thee to ſtand faſt in theſe times, when the myſtery of iniquity is geting up apace, where there is no other Mount <hi>Zion</hi> taught up (as Chriſts ſeat) but what is in us, and ere long in giving heed thereunto, we ſhall not think our ſelves onely Mount <hi>Zion (viz.</hi> Chriſts ſeat) but will alſo think that we are the Chriſt (to wit, God manifeſt in our fleſh) for the mother of Harlots and her daughters <hi>(viz. Rome</hi> and the reſt of the Nations which have been upon her ſides, and ſuck of her breaſt) have taught up ſuch a kind of doctrine as a ſpiritual Reign of Chriſt to be underſtood in ſuch Scriptures, as ſpeak of Chriſts Reign on earth, the which is as a footing for the myſtery of iniquity to work, but thanks be given to our good God that hath given ſome to underſtand the myſtery of the kingdome, who will travel to bring forth the man child (as I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively may ſay) that ſhall rule all Nations with a rod of iron, namely, Chriſt upon his holy hill of <hi>Zion;</hi> therefore read the Prophets diligently, the which I have cited, thou mayeſt alſo at thy leaſure peruſe <hi>Eſdras,</hi> which I have not cited in my diſcourſe, becauſe ſome doubt whether it be Canonicall yea or nay, the which I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to prove it holy writ, becauſe there be Prophets enough that prove the ſame thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Eſdras,</hi> although he ſpeak very fully to it, as in
<pb facs="tcp:118963:6"/>many Chapters, read the <hi>14.</hi> Chapter, and there you ſhall ſee he diſcovereth where the ten Tribes are, and ſhall remain till the Lord ſhall dry up the River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> and then ſhall be brought to <hi>Zion,</hi> and Chriſt ſhall be their King; and indeed, the great reaſon why the <hi>Jews</hi> did not believe in Chriſt, was becauſe they underſtood not that he ſhould come twice on earth, firſt to ſuffer, &amp; then to reign: but at his firſt coming, they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he would reſtore all things, and reign as King; neither will they believe till they ſee him come in that manner, in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory; then ſhall they ſay, lo, this is our God, we have waited for him: and ſo I ſhall ceaſe at preſent, deſiring thee alſo to be waiting for Chriſt, that thou mayeſt be found worthy of the Kingdome, and ſit down therein with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the which is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of thy friend,</p>

Rutton</hi> (in that caſe) which did ſay; <hi>That ſprinkling might be called Baptiſm, becauſe it was ſo ſet down in the book of Common-prayers;</hi> the which was more honeſtly ſpoken than to ſay, that the word <hi>Baptizo</hi> is taken frequently for ſprinkling: but to the examination of your cited text, Matth. 3.11. <hi>He ſhall Baptize you with the Holy Ghoſt and with fire and</hi> (ſay you) <hi>are not ſanctified men rather ſprinkled than plounged with the ſpirit?

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118963:8"/>born of God ſinneth not, but keepeth himſelf that the evil one toucheth him not.</hi> This is truth whether you and your bene-fellowes or bountiful friends can witneſs the ſame (in you) ye or nay: not (that I ſay) that the godly are free from temptation, for neither was Chriſt; nor do I ſay that it is impoſſible that the ſanctified ones may be overtaken in fault,
<note place="margin">The godly ſin not with the wils conſent but their minds and hearts are pure unto the Lord.</note> yet I do ſay and affirm, that the godly or ſanctified man ſinneth not with the conſent of the will, although it is poſſible for him to be overtaken unawares through the ſlites of Satan, but however he keepeth his minde and heart pure to God, and ſo through the ſpirit mortifieth the deeds of the fleſh, and brings into ſubjection ſuch thoughts and imaginations as are offenſive unto God; and if it otherwiſe fall out that ſome that were ſanctified &amp; waſhed throughly did turn again to the wallowing in the mire, this was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſanctified but in part, but becauſe when they were waſhed and thorowly waſhed and made perfect,

               <hi>He that believeth on me as ſaith the Scriptures, out of his belly ſhall ſlow rivers of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and this he ſpake of the ſpirit that afterward he meant to give to them that beleeve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo to your ſecond text, which is, <hi>Matth</hi> 20.22. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he hath a Baptiſm to be Baptiſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> meaning that of his ſufferings, the which (ſay you) <hi>was rather ſprinkling than plounging, having his head crowned with thorns, and his hands and feet nailed and wounded, yet he was not wounded in each part of his body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, I hope no ſober minded man will ſay, that our bleſſed Saviour was not plounged or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed in ſorrow, when he cryed, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Whoſe ſorrow like unto his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118963:9"/>
               <note place="margin">Math. 26.46.</note> and what meant thoſe great drops like blood that trickled from him,
<note place="margin">Eſa. 53.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.</note> and himſelf falling flat to the ground before he was nailed to the Croſs? what ſober man dareth to ſay that Chriſt was not plounged into ſorrow, and greef and ſufferings? and the Apoſtle tells you, <hi>that if one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſuffer all the members ſuffer with it;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cot. 12.26.</note> ſo then Chriſts ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings was no ſmall ſufferings, nor in part, but very great in every part, ſo as to preſs him flat to the ground; ſo that there never was any mans ſufferings to be compared to His, and yet there were many before him that were over whel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in ſufferings, as you may ſee <hi>Hebrews</hi> 11. Chap. And ſo you may ſee that neither of your reaſons which you cited, to prove Baptiſm to be taken for ſprinkling are of any weight; as firſt, ſanctification is not wrought in part, (in the Soul) but thorowly, as I have already proved, allthough I could ſay much more. Again, The Spirit of God (in the Soul) is not compared to a little water, but to very much waters, even rivers of waters.
<note place="margin">Chriſt was more than ſprinkled with ſufferings, for he was ploun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into great ſufferings, the Burden there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cauſed him to fall under it flat to the ground, and made him cry, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi>
               </note> And ſecondly, that the Baptiſm of Chriſt in ſufferings, was not ſmall or in part, but very great in every part, that being overwhelmed he fell to the ground, and ſweat drops like blood before he was nailed on the Croſs, and when he was nailed on the Croſs his heart was overwhelmed with ſorrow, that he cryed out in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Soul, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> He troad the Wine-preſs of the wrath of God and poured out his Soul to death, and groaned under that great oppreſſion; the which clearly ſheweth to us, that Chriſt was not ſprinkled but plounged or overwhelmed in ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.</p>
            <p>And again, Whereas ye would have me <hi>Remember how the parallel lyeth between Johns Baptiſm, and Chriſts Baptiſm with the Spirit,</hi> Act. 1.5. <hi>and Chriſts giving the Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to pouring, in reſpect of the few drops in the time of the Law by ſprinkling, for Chriſt only was plounged with it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it without meaſure, and ſo was his water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer briefly, the ſtrength of your reaſon lyeth in theſe words, <hi>There is a parallel</hi> (ſay you) <hi>between
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118963:9"/>Johns Baptiſm and Chriſts, and Johns Baptiſm was that of water, and Chriſts that of the Spirit;</hi> and (ſay you) <hi>Chriſts Baptiſm was by pouring of a few drops in the time of the Law,</hi> and hence you conclude, that becauſe Chriſts Baptiſm (with the Spirit) was by ſpringling, (as you ſay) and yet is called Baptiſm equivolent with that of <hi>Johns,</hi> which was with water; therefore water Baptiſm may be by ſprinkling; and this is the ſum &amp; whole ſtrength of reaſon that you produce.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> And firſt to the firſt; There might be a true parallel between <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm and Chriſts, <hi>John</hi> did dip or thorowly waſh the people (of the Regons) of <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>

<note place="margin">Joel 2.28.</note> (with other Prophets) ſpeaketh of ſprinkling many Nations,

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118963:10"/>on earth, as well as three in Heaven; but I ſhall be brief.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly,
<note place="margin">1 John 5.7, 8.</note> whereas you ſay, that Chriſt was Baptiſed with the Spirit, or plounged receiving it without meaſure, and ſo was his Baptiſm with water, from whence you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Chriſt was plounged in <hi>Jordan</hi> to manifeſt to the Sons of men, that as he was plounged with the Spirit, ſo he was alſo plounged in water to ſignifie his being plounged with (or in) the Spirit.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, and ſay, that if it be true what you ſay, that Chriſt was plounged in water, to repreſent that he was plounged with the Spirit, receiving it without meaſure, and if that be the onely reaſon that Chriſt was dipped or plounged (as you ſeem to affirm) then none muſt be dipped or plounged but ſuch as have received the Spirit without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and it alſo doth imply, that the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and ſome of your children the which you have formerly dipped, have received the Spirit without meaſure, ſo that your own words imply a contradiction;

            <p>But to paſs on to your diſcourſe, you ask me what I think of that known place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. in theſe words, <hi>all our fathers were Baptiſed in the Cloud and Sea, and</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that was a water Baptiſm, yet they went on dry ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I know the Text ſaith, that they were all Baptiſed, (<hi>viz.</hi> all the fathers) but how you will prove it to be water Baptiſm, I know not, for the Apoſtle calleth it no ſuch thing, onely ſayeth, they were Baptiſed; and we know there is a Baptiſm of ſufferings and of the Spirit, and if I ſhould affirm that it was a Baptiſm of the Spirit, and of fiery tryals, to try who would murmur, or who would ſtand ſtill and truſt in God, to ſee his Salvation, I know not how you could deny it upon good grounds; but that it was a Baptiſm of the ſpirit I think no ſober man will deny, becauſe both the Text in <hi>Exodus,</hi> and that in the <hi>Corinths,</hi> imply ſo much; for we finde that the Angel of Gods preſence, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118963:10"/>his Spirit, was a light to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but the camp of the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> he darkned, and alſo it is ſaid, they eat of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual meat, and ſo forth; and we may (very well) ſee if we are not blinde, that Gods Spiritual preſence was very great to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Cloud, being a light to lead them in their journey to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and alſo his Spiritual preſence, great in the Sea, in making it to be a wall to them on the right hand and on the left, that they wet not ſo much as their ſhoe, brims, and therein God manifeſted his Spiritual preſence to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and if any were Baptiſed in water, it was not <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> but <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt, the which were plounged and overwhelmed in the great depth, but the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were lead and directed and upholden with more than an ordinary work, and manifeſtation of Gods Spirit; and becauſe I ſtudy brevity, and alſo that you are haſting away for <hi>Ireland,</hi> I ſhall leave this particular with this Requeſt, deſiring you to ſhow before you go, where ever that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was called water Baptiſm, the which is ſpoken of in that firſt of <hi>Corinths;</hi> but if you ſeriouſly weigh the occaſion of the words, they will eaſily ſhow you, that the Baptiſm there mentioned is a Baptiſm of the Spirit, becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle was there, ſhewing, what judgments fell upon Gods people of olds for their ſins, to afright (at I may ſay) the <hi>Corinths</hi> that were a carnal people; as if the Apoſtle ſhould have ſaid, <hi>take heed of ſin, for that will bring Gods wrath on you,</hi> and to take off that objection that the <hi>Corinths</hi> might uſe, in ſaying, <hi>but ſurely the Lord will not deſtroy us, for he hath given us his Holy Spirit, and he that hath done this for us, will not now deſtroy us;</hi> but the Apoſtle anſwering them on this wiſe, (as if he ſhould have ſaid) <hi>it is true, he hath Baptiſed you with his Spirit according to his promiſe, and the viſable gifts doth appear, yet take heed of ſin, for otherwiſe God will deſtroy you, for be not ignorant of this, that our fathers were Baptiſed as well as you, and with the ſame Spirit, for the Rock that followed them was Chriſt, yet God was diſpleaſed with them, and deſtroyed them, and theſe things was</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>for your example and admonition:</hi> but now if this had been but a water baptiſme (that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118963:11"/>ſaith) <hi>our fathers were Baptized withal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Apoſtle ſheweth the <hi>Corinths</hi> that the Fathers were Baptiſed with the Spirit as well as they and yet God deſtroyed them, that ſo the <hi>Corinths</hi> might not boaſt of their gifts, and take liberty to ſin, leaſt they alſo were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</note> then the <hi>Corinths</hi> might have made this reply and ſaid, <hi>it is true, all the Baptiſm or the waſhing with water in the Law, was but appertaining unto the fleſh, and alſo we know,</hi> Symon Magus <hi>was Baptized with water, and yet caſt away; but we have been Baptiſed with the Spirit, and therefore a beloved people, and God will not caſt us of;</hi> and upon this account the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle endeavoureth to inform them, that the Fathers were Baptiſed with the Spirit, for Chriſt was with the Church in the wilderneſs, and alſo lead them, ſometimes going before them, ſometimes followed them between the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and the Camp of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the red Sea, and thus Gods Spiritual preſence was manifeſted unto them, both in the Cloud and in the Sea; in the Cloud, by being a light to lead them, and keeping the <hi>Egyptians</hi> from them; and in the Sea, by making the waters a wall to them, ſo as that they were not wet thereby.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould be objected out of the 77. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16, 17. <hi>The waters ſaw God, and the depts were troubled, the Clouds poured out water, the skies ſent forth a ſound, the voice of the thunders were in the Heavens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, This is nothing to that which is mentioned in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> neither was that Cloud there ſpoken of, the Clouds mentioned in the ſeventy ſeven Pſalm.</p>
            <p>And again, whereas you ask me what I think <hi>of ſprinkling of Bloud in the time of the Law, ſo often mentioned, was it not a type</hi> (ſay you) <hi>of the blood of ſprinkling,</hi> Heb. 12.24.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, It may borrow that terme, the blood of ſprinkling, from that of ſpringling in the Law, or it may be called the blood of ſprinkling, becauſe the efficacy of it was to be diſperſed abroad to many, by ſpeaking better things for them, than the blood of <hi>Abel:</hi> but this maketh nothing for your purpoſe,

            <p>And whereas you ask me, <hi>why ſprinkling on Infants may not ſignify Chriſts blood ſhed for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:118963:11"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> becauſe in the firſt place, God never did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Infants to be ſprinkled in the time of the Goſpel, or elſewhere, to ſignify Chriſts blood ſhed for them. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Becauſe Baptiſm is not (barely) a ſignification of Chriſts blood ſhed, but alſo of his burial and Reſurrection, the which cannot be ſignified by ſprinkling; &amp; in ſprinkling in the time of the Law there was a cleanſing but in part, (<hi>viz.</hi> the fleſh) and but for a time; namely, one year, for there was a remembrance of ſin every year, but now out cleanſing is of another nature, not in part, but by one offering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for ever ſuch as are ſanctified; and therefore, that which ſignifieth that great work is not a little water, but much water, whereby perſons muſt be thorowly waſhed, and therefore the water in Baptiſm, is compared to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Noah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 20, 21.</note> the which (I think) no wiſe man will think was very little; but that Baptiſm doth ſignifie burial as well as Chriſts death, ſee the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. in theſe words, <hi>Therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into his death, That like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in nenneſs of life;</hi> and as ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinths, If the dead riſe not, Why are we Baptiſed for dead?</hi> that is, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>why are we then Baptized to ſignifie a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, Whereas you ſay, <hi>Peter was for a kinde of plounging</hi> (John 13.) <hi>till better Catichiſed by our Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, from thence it is evident, that it was the onely practice in Baptiſm to waſh or plounge the whole man in water,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Peters</hi> words ſpoken in <hi>John</hi> 13, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth much for total waſhing in Baptiſm, and no whit againſt it.</note> becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> was ignorant of waſhing in part, and cryeth out not onely my feet but my hands and my head; but however that was not an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm, (as aforeſaid) that Chriſt taught his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but it was an ordinanee, which Chriſt inſtituted to waſh the feet of thoſe that were Baptiſed, (as aforeſaid) and therefore this maketh much againſt you, and will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lr teach you, that it was a total waſhing or plounging, that was Chriſts and his diſciples practice in Baptiſm, but <hi>Peter</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:118963:12"/>wanted inſtruction about that Ordinance of waſhing the Diſciples feet, and becauſe I am occaſioned to ſpeak as to that Ordinance from the precedent diſcourſe,

<note place="margin">God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this world to confound the wiſe, and the weak things, and the baſe and deſpiſed things, hath God choſen, that ſo the wiſdom of this world might come to naught, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 27, 28, 29.</note> and that <hi>God hath choſen the fooliſh things of this world to confound the wiſe, and the deſpiſed things to bring to naught that which ſeemeth to be mighty,</hi> (in wiſdom) <hi>that no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again, whereas you ſay, <hi>That you are ſure that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is by ſprinkling, and that it was a Gopſpel promiſe,</hi> Ezek. 36.25, compared with <hi>Epheſians</hi> 5.26.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer briefly, and ſay, That the promiſe in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. is made to ſuch a people as are not accounted (by the Holy Spirit) to be a Goſpel people, but as touching the Goſpel they will be enemies as you may ſee in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. and alſo, you may ſee that the promiſe <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 36, doth not ſpeak of any <hi>Gentile</hi> Church, nor any Church of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> being called by a Goſpel preaching, but it is concerning Gods purpoſe, as touching the whole houſe of Iſrael (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that the Spirit ſhall be poured out upon them, when the time is accompliſhed, that is to ſay, after their return out of captivity, and the fulneſs of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and when they ſhall ſee, their KING THE LORD JESUS coming in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118963:12"/>the Clouds of Heaven, then will the Lord poure on them the Spirit of praiſe, and ſupplication, and then ſhall they ſay, <hi>Loe this is our God,</hi> &amp; that is the time when all tears ſhall be wiped from their eys, and then if they ſearch for ſin in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> they finde none: But becauſe I will haſten, take notice of theſe Scriptures in the room of many; ſee firſt the Text itſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36, 8, 9, 10, &amp; 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, &amp; 33, 34, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Jerem</hi> 31, 1, 2, 3, 4, to the end: ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.12. compared with 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 36, 37, 38. <hi>Eſay</hi> 59, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, ſee <hi>Fſay</hi> chapters 11. and 12. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14 9. <hi>Rom</hi> 11, 25, 26, 27, 28. It would be too large, to ſpeak to theſe &amp; the like Scriptures; but take notice, that the general call of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of that Prophecie, will not be by the ordina y preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, but by that extraordinary work of God, the which is to be wrought on the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at that time, when the <hi>Redeemer ſhall come to Zyon, and turn tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion from Jacob;</hi> and that is the time, that the Lord will ſprinkle clean water on them, and then they ſhall be clean.

            <p>The next thing is, a ſtory you tell me, <hi>of your practice of dipping ſometimes, if your Climate will admit of it, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that direction in the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That to lay the practice of ſprinkling, upon the coldneſ of the Climate, (as ſome of you do) and upon a Rule of Charity, appeareth to me, as though you had ſome Charity, but no Faith at all, to beleeve, that God is able to ſupport perſons under the right adminiſtration of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118963:13"/>Gods Ordinances;
<note place="margin">God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be with his to ſupport them, both in the fire and in the water.</note> but if you ſhould ſay, that ſome chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have dyed by being dipped, (as ſome of you have ſaid). I ſhould anſwer, it was becauſe they were not fit ſubjects; and if they were fit ſubjects (that is, ſuch as God hath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be Baptiſed) he would have carried them thorow that Ordinance as well as he did ſupport them in circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and my experience doth teach me, that no weather is ſo cold, as that it bringeth the leaſt prejudice to any, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be of a very weak conſtitution of body; and therefore lay not the fault on the cold Climate, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the ſubject is not fit to paſs under that Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay, <hi>You wonder how the</hi> Jaylor <hi>and his, could be plounged, Baptiſed they were, and it was night, and in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood in Priſon, for although it is ſaid, be called them forth, that is,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>out of the Inner-Priſon into which they were thruſt, yet are they brought into his houſe afterwards; ſo that the</hi> Jaylor<hi>'s henſe-hold went to the Apoſtle, and not the Apoſtles into the</hi> Jaylors <hi>houſe to preach, but be it in Jaylor houſe, where was water enough to plounge him and his, in ſo dry a Countrey; did he venter trow, to carry them to ſome river, his fear, if not his care hindred; but had they a large tub of water there, and were they plounged, how came they being wet, to ſit at meat preſent with the Apoſtles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, and firſt, that I think it will not be worth my pains, or ink and paper, to anſwer that which hath ſo little weight of reaſon in it; but becauſe I would willingly take notice of all what you ſay, and alſo, becauſe you might not think weakneſs to be ſtrength, I ſhall trace (by way of anſwer) what you have written.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay, you <hi>wonder how the</hi> Jaylor <hi>and his could be plounged, Baptized they were, it was night, and in likelyhood in Priſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, I might ſay, (<hi>ſtultos admiramini &amp; eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſcite</hi>) there is no great ground for you to wonder, how or where the <hi>Jaylor</hi> ſhould finde water enough to be plounged withal, ſeeing man cannot ſubſiſt without water, and alſo, becauſe the earth is ſo full of waters (but it is not worth while to ſpend time as to this.)</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:118963:13"/>
            <p> And that they were not Baptized in the priſon, is clear, for the <hi>Iaylor</hi> called them forth, that is, ſay you, <hi>from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner priſon in which they were thruſt,</hi> and ſo you conclude, they might be ſtill in the outward priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It is a very likely matter, that the <hi>Jaylor</hi> was not afraid to bring the Apoſtle into his houſe, and to eat and drink with them, and yet was afraid to bring them forth of the outward priſon; But whereas you ſay, it was into the outward priſon they were brought, and not out of the whole Priſon, is but your words, it is not the words of the Scripture.</p>
            <p>Secondly whereas you ſay, <hi>that the</hi> Jaylors <hi>fear if not his care, would not ſuffer him to go to ſome river.</hi> I pray, what fear was the <hi>Jaylor</hi> in, did he fear, that if he ſhould go ſome diſtance from his houſe, that then the Apoſtles would have run away? Surely he did not fear it, for he had a proof of them before, he knew that they were not flinchers, to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, for then they might have run away before, for the Priſon doors were ſet wide open to them; yet it is granted, that the <hi>Jaylor</hi> was in a fear and did tremble, but it was becauſe he feared his Salvation, and upon that account, he came and fell down before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylus,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Love caſteth out fear, the <hi>Iaylor</hi> was not afraid to go to any water that was conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to be Baptiſed.</note> and therefore doubtleſs, if <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, that they muſt have gone many a mile to have been Baptized, he would not have queſtioned the buſineſs, for Converſion is of this nature, (whether you can witneſs it yea or nay,) that it is willing, to do any thing in Gods ſervice, that God or his people doth teach, without fear of ill conveniences, and indeed love caſteth out (all ſuch ſlaveth) fear; have you read in any place of Scripture, that the <hi>Iaylor</hi> was afraid to go to a River with the Apoſtles? if you have, I pray ſhew it in your next writing if you can.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>if they were plounged, how came they to ſit at meat preſently with the Apoſtles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Doth the Text ſay, that they ſate preſently at meat with the Apoſtles, read the Text, Act. 16.33, 34, <hi>And he took them the ſame hour of the night, and waſhed their ſtripes, and was Baptiſed, he and all his ſtraight way, and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118963:14"/>when he had brought them into his houſe, he fel meat before them, and rejoyced, believing in God with all his houſe.</hi> Here is no ſuch thing ſaid as you ſay, that he ſat preſently at meat with the Apoſtles; but admit it were ſo, that he did ſit preſently at meat, yet it was not ſo preſently, but they firſt made themſelves ready; I might ask you, how the <hi>Eunuch</hi> did to ſit wet in his Chariot,
<note place="margin">Act. 8, 38, 39.</note> after <hi>Philip</hi> had Baptiſed him; for it is evident, that both <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> went down into the water, and the Text faith, <hi>That when they were come up out of the water,</hi> (mark that) <hi>the Spirit caught away</hi> Philip, <hi>and the</hi> Eunuch <hi>went on his way rejoicing.</hi> But your diſcourſe argueth that you are much beſotted in your underſtanding, and ſo I paſs.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay,
<note place="margin">Circumclſion no tipe of Baptiſm, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cometh in the room and place of it.</note> (Doctor <hi>Feath</hi> faith) that Circumciſion to Iſrael, was as Baptiſm to us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> you would have done well, if you had ſhewed how he, or you could prove it, the which you have not in the leaſt done, and let me tell you, that I do not beleeve that either D. <hi>Feath,</hi> or you be infallable men, but have your fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in doctrine, as well as in life, and want not errours; but that Circumciſion to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is not as Baptiſm to us, is evident.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Circumciſion was not ſo much as the leaſt type of Baptiſm, but rather is a type of Faith, the which giveth right to Baptiſm, that as the fore-skin of the fleſh was to be taken of, in order to the giving the ſubject right to <hi>Canaan,</hi> (a ſleſhly bleſſing) ſo now the cutting off the fore skin of ignorance, and unbelief, from the heart, giveth right to the Heavenly land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſo that the Circumciſion of the fleſh, was not as Baptiſm, or a type of it, but it was a type of the Circumciſion of the heart, according to the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom 2.28. <hi>He is not a Jew which is one outwardly, neither is that Circumciſion, which is outward in the fleſh;</hi> (for that was then taken away, and the other come in the room thereof) <hi>but he is a law which is one outwardly, and Circumciſion that which is of the heart, in the Spirit and not in the letter, whoſe praiſe is not of men but of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:118963:14"/>
            <p> Secondly, Circumciſion never required Faith in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of it, the which Baptiſm doth, ſee Act. 8.37, and that Faith is not required in Circumciſion, read my <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons Down-fall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Baptiſm or in the ſubject to be Baptiſed, but not in the ſubject Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.</note> which ſheweth it, and peradvanture more of it anon, if it lay in my way: and that Baptiſm did not come in the room and place of Circumciſion, is evident, becauſe that Circumciſion was practiſed ſince Baptiſm, for Baptiſm began in <hi>Iohns</hi> time, and Chriſt was Baptiſed with ſeveral others, and yet Circumciſion was not taken away till Chriſts death, by nailing it to his Croſs; and therefore they being both practiſed together, one could not come in the room and place of the other. For illuſtration, take this compariſon, <hi>a Parſenage</hi> Barne, cannot be built in the room or place of <hi>Sutten</hi> Church, unleſs that firſt be pulled down, and taken out of the way, neither can Baptiſme come in the room of Circumciſion, unleſs Circumciſion be taken out of the way; the which was not as I have already ſhewed.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay, <hi>That Circumciſion was but in one part, and ſo Baptiſm may be but in one part;</hi> to which you cite the Hebrew word (Tabhal) from <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 3.15. in theſe words, <hi>And the feet of the Prieſts that bare the Ark, was dipped in the brim of the water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, and ſay, this maketh nothing for you; for I do affirm, that if a man put his finger into the brim of the water, or his little toe, they are dipped, although it cannot be ſaid the whole man is dipped; but in Baptiſm I have proved, that the whole man muſt be dipped, which is the proper ſignification of the word <hi>Baptizo,</hi> and alſo of the word <hi>Tabhal,</hi> as you have cited it; becauſe, it doth ſignifie not onely a death but a burial and Reſurrection, and therefore according to what you ſay, (both from the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> and the <hi>Greek</hi>) the true ſignification of the word is to dip, onely here lyeth the queſtion, whether every part muſt be dipped, or whether ſome one part will not ſerve; now that which I ſay is, that the whole man muſt be dipped or buried, to ſign fie Chriſts burial and Reſurrection, (as aforeſaid) and if you can prove, it may be done in part, I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118963:15"/>pray ſhew it, and alſo what part it is that ought to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, that we may not be deceived, becauſe you have been a ſpeaking of dipping and waſhing of feet, but not of dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or waſhing of the face,
<note place="margin">Waſhing and ſprinkling, were diſtinct Ordinances in the time of the Law.</note> (or more properly ſprinkling) which is your practice.</p>
            <p>And whereas you would prove if ye could, that the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken of, <hi>Hebrews</hi> 9, 10, 13, is the ſame that is called ſprinkling in the 19. 21. To the which I ſay, you are much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, for there was both waſhing and ſprinkling in the time of the Law, ſo that waſhing was an Ordinance diſtinct from ſprinkling,

                  </gap>.</note> neither was ſprinkling called waſhing, therefore the ſprinkling in the 19 and 22 verſes is not the waſhing in the 10 and 13 verſes; one is <hi>Baptiſmos</hi> and the other <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſmos,</hi> the which, you have granted, that <hi>Baptizo</hi> and <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizo</hi> are not one and the ſame in their ſignification, in the 15 and 16 line of your 4 page; and ſo I ſhall leave this as touching ſprinkling, with ſome arguments to prove, that ſprinkling (the which you uſe in the lieu of Baptiſm) is not the way of God, but dipping, or plounging, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming, or thorrow waſhing the whole man in water, is Gods way; and ſo to the Arguments, and the firſt is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth:</p>
            <p>If Chriſt were given to be a Leader to his people,

And that we ought to follow his examples,

               <note place="margin">The reaſon why <hi>Iohn</hi> ſtald and Baptiſed in <hi>Aenon</hi> was becauſe there was much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> I alſo hope will not be denied, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. and it hath been granted by you that Chriſt was plounged or dipped, as in the third page of your book; but I paſs to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>If the muchneſs of the water was the main reaſon, why <hi>Iohn</hi> did ſtay and Baptiſe at <hi>Aenen,</hi> then the ſprinkling of a little water in Baptiſm is not Gods way; But the muchaeſs
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118963:15"/>of the water was the main reaſon, (that is rendred) why <hi>John</hi> did ſtay and Baptiſe at <hi>Aenon; Ergo,</hi> a little water, or ſpinkling of a little water in Baptiſm is not Gods way: The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, <hi>John</hi> 3.23. the <hi>Major</hi> cannot fairly be queſtioned.</p>

<note place="margin">Cor. 1.17.</note> ſo that the great work is to preach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Souls, and Baptiſm the leſſer. And whereas the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, that Chriſt ſent him not to Baptiſe but to preach, his meaning was, that Baptiſm was not his great work, for I dare ſay, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not any thing in the worſhip and ſervice of God, but what Chriſt appointed, yet he did Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe many,

            <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, that ſuch as do affirm there is but one Covenant, know not what they ſay, nor whereof they do affirm, but I ſhall ſhew, that the Scriptures do reach us, that there is two Covenants, two kinds of blood, to confirm their adminiſtrations, and the firſt Covenant (as in reſpect of enjoyment) was; God gave a temporal land, (<hi>viz Canaan</hi>) to Abraham, as you may ſee, Geneſ. 17.8. the which he and his ſeed ſhould have enjoyed for ever, had they not ſinned, as you may ſee in theſe words, <hi>and I will give to thee and to thy ſeed after thee, the land wherein thou art a ſtranger, all the land of</hi> Canaan <hi>for an everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting poſſeſſion, and I will be their God;</hi> and that <hi>Canaan,</hi> was that which was called and accounted the Covenant, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Circumciſion was called the Covenant, as in reſpect of the adminiſtration of it; ſo was the Law from mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> called the Covenant; but you ſhall ſee that the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (and the bleſſings therein) was that which was the Covenant it ſelf, Exod. 6.4, 5. <hi>And I have alſo eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed my Covenant with them,</hi> (viz. Iſrael) <hi>to give them the land of</hi> Canaan, <hi>the land of their Pilgrimage, wherein they were ſtrangers; and I have heard the groaning alſo of the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>whom the</hi> Egyptians <hi>keep in bondage, and have remembred my Covenant, and I will bring you into the land, concerning which I did ſwear to give it to</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:118963:17"/>Abraham, <hi>and to</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and to</hi> Jacob, <hi>and I will give it to you for an heritage,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit, 26.9.</note> 
               <hi>I am the Lord.</hi> Hence you may ſee, that <hi>Canaan</hi> was the Covenant, together with ſuch like bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, as namely, multiplying of them, not onely in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their bodies, but alſo of the fruits of the earth, and he gave alſo unto them his Laws and Statutes,
<note place="margin">Levit. 18.5.</note> that if they kept them, they ſhould live long in the land; yet theſe things did but appertain to the fleſh, and if they did ſee a future enjoyment, it was by Faith in another (<hi>viz.</hi> the new) Covenant,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.12.</note> for the Law was not of Faith, but the man that kept it ſhould live in it; that is, in ſuch enjoyments as it brought, the which was no other but that of the fleſhly bleſſings;
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.19, 20.</note> and this Covenant had a mediator, (the which was <hi>Moſes</hi>) and it had adminiſtration, and the blood of Bulls,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, &amp; 13.</note> and Goats, to dedicate it; of which I ſhall not ſpeak in particular at preſent; and thus I have found one Covenant, namely, an earthly bleſſing. And now I ſhall paſs to look out a ſecond Covenant. &amp; I doubt not but I ſhall finde out a far better Covenant than that which hath been ſpoken of, although that Covenant was ſuch a Covenant, that no people had the like bleſſings, namely, to have a land flowing with Milk and Honey, and great increaſe, that it was the praiſe of the whole earth: But to ſhew what is that better Covenant, eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes; and as the firſt Covenant was an earthly one, even the earthly land of <hi>Canaan</hi> with the bleſſings appertaining thereunto; ſo the new, or better Covenant, is the Heavenly land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that is eſtabliſhed on better promiſes; ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Iſrael</hi> brake that Covenant, or the conditions of that Covenant, ſo that they were caſt out; yet it will not be ſo in the time when we are put into the poſſeſſion of this New-Covenant, or the thing Covenanted; we do already enjoy it by Faith, although we have not a foots breadth in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent poſſeſſion of it, as the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was given to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> for his Seed, when he or they had not one foots breadth in it in preſent poſſeſſion; but after they di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But becauſe you affirm, <hi>whether our children ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from the priviledge, which the children of the Jewes did enjoy in Circumciſion; and whether Circumciſion yea or nay was a priviledge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, and firſt I ſay, That Circumciſion was a priviledge, that without it the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might not be admitted to live in <hi>Canaan,</hi> nor enjoy thoſe earthly priviledges, for no uncircumciſed perſon muſt come there; and this priviledge alſo they had thereby, to be taught the fear of God by their being in ſuch a plice, where the fear of God was to be learned, the which beleevers children now do enjoy, without the heavy yoak of Circumciſion,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118963:18"/>or without being Baptiſed, you may ſee this clearly diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, if you read my book entituled, <hi>Dagons Down-fall;</hi> and ſo I ſhall paſs to that federate holineſs which you ſpeak of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. <hi>Beleevers children are federately Holy</hi> (ſay you) <hi>and therefore are to be received by Baptiſm into Chriſts Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, that your word federately, &amp; your matter intimated in it, are far ferched conſequences, that the holineſs ſpoken of in 1 <hi>Corinths</hi> 7. will not admit any to Baptiſme, the which if it would, then the unbelieving Wife or Husband (which is as holy as the Child) ought to be Baptized, and how far that is from truth, I ſhall leave the Reader to judge; but that the Text doth ſay, that the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is Holy, read it, and you ſhall ſee to difference in the word Sanctification and Holineſs in that place, for <hi>Tindal</hi> readeth it thus: <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>So that the word may be red, the unbeleeving woman is Holy, or hallowed to or by the man, as well as ſanctified; but the holineſs mentioned, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. is no other but a matrimonial holineſs, as I alſo have proved in my precedent treatiſe; and ſo I paſs and leave you to read your anſwer there.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay, <hi>God owned thoſe children preſented to him in Circumciſion,</hi> Ezek. 16.20, 21. <hi>and called them his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, if you were demanded how you could prove, that thoſe children were Circumciſed, you would be much troubled to prove it, for ſurely their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were not ſo careful, to give heed to Gods Commands, the which if they had, they would not have offered their children to <hi>Molech,</hi> which was fobidden, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore Circumciſed they were not doubtleſs, and if they were prove it.
<note place="margin">Exod. 22.39. Exod. 13.2. Nehem. 10.35, 36, 37.</note> But you will ſay how cometh it to paſs that God calleth them his children?

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118963:18"/>them his children, yet take notice that I do not deny but God did own ſuch as was offered to him in Circumciſion, but it doth not follow therefore, that he will own ſuch offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in Baptiſm; for he had commanded children to be Circumciſed, at eight dayes old, and therefore good reaſon that he ſhould own them, but he never commanded chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of eight dayes old to be Baptiſed, and therefore it is a vaine conceit to think that God will own that which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appointed.</p>
            <p>Again you ſay, <hi>That the premiſe under the Goſpel is to Beleevers and their children, by vertue of the Parents Faith,</hi> Act. 2.39.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Text doth not ſay, that the promiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel is to beleevers and their children, upon their Parents Faith, ſurely your eyes be very dim, or your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding very ſhallow, in looking on that place; ſee the Text, Act. 2.39. <hi>Repent and be Baptiſed every one of you, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> (of the gift of the Holy Spirit) <hi>is to you and your</hi>
               <note place="margin">Children in their non-age are not heirs to the Holy Spirit and heaven, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Fathers Faith as you fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceit.</note> 
               <hi>children, and to all that are afar of, even to ſo many as the Lord our God ſhall call.</hi> Now I pray ſee, doth this Text ſay, that the Goſpel promiſe belongeth to children of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, upon their Parents Faith? the text hath not ſuch a conſequence in it, the meaning of the Text is briefly thus, the <hi>Jews</hi> were pricked at the heart, for Crucifying of Chriſt, and deſiring his blood to be on them &amp; their children, &amp; the Apoſtle knowing that all ſins ſhould be forgiven, unleſs that againſt the Holy Ghoſt, ſaith to them, (not when they were beleevers but before they did beleeve,) <hi>Repent,</hi> but as if they ſhould ſay, there is no hope of mercy if we ſhould repent, yet there is ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> for God hath promiſed to pour out af his Spirit (in the laſt dayes) upon all fleſh, and alſo on your children, even on your ſons and daughters, and therefore your condition is not ſo bad as by you ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, nor your childrens, but they ſhall receive the Spirit even ſo many of them as God ſhall call, your wicked practice in Crucifying Chriſt hath not ſo far deprived you, or them, from mercy, but if you or they obey the voice of Gods call,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118963:19"/>he will give you or they after you, the Holy Spirit, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repent every one of you; here is ground enough for you to repent, and to be Baptiſed, and gladly to walk in Chriſts wayes;
<note place="margin">That promiſe <hi>Act</hi> 2.39. was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Holy Spirit, and it was made to all upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Faith, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to thoſe poor wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls, that they might have ground to repent and beleeve the Goſpel.</note> and thus you ſee the Text ſaith the promiſe was to them before they did beleeve, that they might have ground to beleeve, and obey the Goſpel; and therefore this maketh not for beleeves ſeed, being under a Goſpel promiſe, for theſe did not beleeve, when the Apoſtle ſaith, the promiſe is unto you; but if the promiſe of the Spirit be made to all children, upon their Parents Faith, then every beleevers child moſt conſequently have the Holy Spirit, or otherwiſe God not ſo good as his promiſe; but the promiſe in Acts the ſecond, is a general promiſe of the giving forth of the Holy Spirit to all fleſh, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentilis,</hi> Fathers and Children, even ſo many as are the called ones of God; but in my former Treatiſe I have ſhewed the reaſon why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle maketh mention of their children in this Text, and ſo refer you to that, further to peruſe, and paſs to the next thing; the which is, <hi>A cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that in that particular, your ſelves do lie under evill in denying children Church priviledges; namely, that priviledge of the Lords Supper, the which of right belongeth to every member of Chriſts Church; for they that were (or are) to be Baptiſed or to continue in the Doctrine of Chriſt, in breaking of bread, and prayer, and Baptiſm is not properly a Church priviledge, but that which is to be done without the Church, and thoſe priviledges that are properly accounted Church priviledges, you do deprive children of; and alſo when you write again, reſolve this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether the Lords Supper of right do not belong to all that are Baptiſed, unleſs they are caſt out forſin; and if ſo, then clear your ſelves if you can of depriving children of Church priviledges; but you may ſee this alſo, is diſcourſed and anſwered, in my former Treatiſe entituled, <hi>Dagons Down-fall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the Examination of that cited place, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.29. <hi>Go diſciple all Nations,</hi> or make diſciples
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118963:19"/>all Nations, and Baptize them; to which you would have me read, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 4 1, 2, 3. the which is equivolent with the words in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. the which is read thus: <hi>When therefore the Lord knew how the Phariſees had beard, that Ieſus made and Baptized more Diſciples than Iohn,</hi> and ſo forth; from whence you would conclude, that <hi>Diſciples were made by Baptiſme,</hi> as you make children Diſciples by Baptiſme (as you ſay.

            <p> To which I anſwer: and firſt, you are as much miſtaken in the place cited (by you) as in the matter, for the Text is in <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13. and in <hi>Luke</hi> 18.16. but if you were onely miſtaken in the citing of the place, it might be borne with, but you are much miſtaken in the matter; and firſt you ſay, <hi>their Parents were in covenant with God;</hi> how you will prove it,

            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, that their experience taught them, that Chriſt was able to cure their children of what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe ſoever, becauſe he made it his practiſe to cure all manner of ſickneſs and diſeaſes, inſomuch, as a great multitude of ſick folk followed him, and he cured them of what diſeaſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had; and ſuch an opinion they had of Chriſt, as ſome of our Nation have of skilful Phyſitians; and that was all the good opinion they had of our Saviour, that I can find: <hi>But our Saviour had a good opinion of them, in that he ſaid, ſuffer them to come and bring their children and did for them as their Friends deſired him to do.</hi> To which I anſwer, I never, or ſeldom find in Scripture that Chriſt did deny to do good to any, but did go about doing good; and hence it came to paſs, that he had compaſſion on the multitude, and fed them, and upon that account he had cuſtom enough, and had many followers, it was not becauſe they had a good opinion of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118963:20"/>Chriſt, as touching ſpiritual vertue in him; but that they might have their bellies filled, <hi>Ye follow me not</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>becauſe of the miracles, but becauſe ye eat of the loaves, and were filled, Iohn</hi> 6.26. So then, there be many had a good opinion of Chriſt, and followed him ſo long as he gave them food and health. And whereas you ſuppoſe, that <hi>I think that the bleſſing that Chriſt did beſtow on the children, was a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſing.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And now that you may ſee what bleſſing this was, we may conſider the dependance of the Text, with ſome other Texts of Scripture, the which will ſhew us what bleſſing it was that Chriſt did beſtow on them; And firſt, to the dependence of the Tex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p> And whereas the Text ſaith, <hi>Of ſuch is the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and you ſay, <hi>deny not Baptiſm to the Heirs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer and ſay, that little ones are heirs to Heaven, I ſhall not deny, for where there is no Law, there is no tranſgreſſion, and where there is no tranſgreſſion, there is no puniſhment; yet it doth not follow that they muſt be Baptiſed, becauſe Baptiſme, and Repentance, and Faith, is to break off ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted perſonally, that thoſe perſons might be heirs of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſo that Ordinance properly belongeth to ſuch as are not abſolute heirs to Heaven; (I ſpeak after the manner of men,) but to ſuch as are penetent ſinners, that thereby they might be made heirs to Heaven; but of this you may ſee more at large in my other Treatiſe: theſe two things take notice of, and ſo ſhall paſs; the firſt is, that I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that Children are ever the better, or nearer to Heaven, becauſe they are Children of Believers: neither that others are nearer to hell, becauſe they are unbelievers children. And ſecondly, I do not believe, and I know alſo you can never prove, that thoſe Children were the Children of Believing Parents.</p>
            <p>Again, you ſay, <hi>Children are counted Diſciples, from</hi> Exod. 15, 5, 10. <hi>Why put ye a yoak on the Diſciples nick,</hi> meaning (ſay you) <hi>on believers, and their Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, that they were not children that were called Diſciples, but Brethren, and they were ſuch as were capable to be delivered, for the Text ſaith, <hi>There were certain that came and taught the Brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">It cannot be proved that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe that are called Diſciples in the fifteenth of the <hi>Acts</hi> were children in non-age.</note> (mark that) <hi>that if they were not circumciſed, after the manner of Moſes,</hi> (that is to obſerve the law of Moſes,) <hi>they could not be ſaved;</hi> and theſe are the very perſons that the Apoſtle calleth Diſciples in the tenth verſe; and you may ſee what they are forbidden in the twentieth verſe, the which ſhe weth that they were not Children: but you may ſee this alſo fully anſwered as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, only take this by the way, from whence you may ſee that Children of ſeven or eight dayes old, (or thereabouts) cannot be Chriſts Diſciples, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>That he that denyeth not himſelf, and taketh up his Croſs, and followeth him,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118963:21"/>cannot be his Diſciple;</hi> the which a Child cannot do, therefore cannot be Chriſts Diſciple, ſee <hi>Dagons Downfal;</hi> and ſo I paſs to the next thing; which is ſay you, <hi>That which is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenty mentioned in the Law need not to be ſo frequently menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Goſpel; and what more frequent in the Ola Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than Gods promiſe to be a God to them, and their Seed:</hi> your inſtances is that of the Sabbath, ſay you, <hi>The Sabbath being moral and perpetual, and frequently commanded to be kept in the law, need not to be commanded to be kept in the New Teſtament.</hi>

            <p>To which I anſwer and ſay: and firſt, that how you will prove it to be moral and perpetual, I know not, if you ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly read <hi>Heb.</hi> 4, 3, 4, you may ſee, that the Seventh dayes Sabbath, as it did look at the ſeventh year of Jubilee, and the ſeven thouſand years to be a general reſt and releaſe; ſo it did type out our Reſt, from the ſervilty and bondage of the Law, and ſheweth that our Reſt is already began in Chriſt, ſo ſaith the Author to the Hebrews 4, 3, 4 5 <hi>For we which have believed do enter into reſt, as he ſaid, as I have ſworn in my wrath, if they ſhall enter into my reſt, although the work was finiſhed from the foundation of the world, for he ſpake in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place of the Heavenly day on this wiſe, and God reſted the Seventh day from all his works.</hi> From whence you may ſee, that the Seventh day is typical,
<note place="margin">The Seventh days Sabbath not moral, but typical.</note> and he is worthy to be ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death, who contendeth for the Sabbath day under the Goſpel; and yet breaketh it by doing his own works: your own practice denyeth the morality of the Seventh days Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and indeed the day was typical doubtleſs; and further, let me tell you, that I do not obſerve the firſt day by vertue of the inſtitution of the Seventh day; but I keep that day ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Chriſts ſervice upon another account: and if you keep it upon the account of a Sabbath by vertue of the old inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then for the time to come learn to keep it in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſo, or otherwiſe you are condemned in the things that you allow.</p>

            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, and that very briefly, that the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maintenance is a free maintenance, free from compulſion; ſee Chriſt ſending out his ſeventy commanding them to eat ſuch things as was freely offered unto them; and where ever there is a true Goſpel Miniſter, and a true Goſpel people, there will be no want of communicating each to other, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; the Miniſter will freely communicate ſpirituals, and

<note place="margin">Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with their hands ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to be chargeable to the Church.</note> this will be in a true Goſpel Church; and alſo the Miniſter ought to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour with his hands, rather than to be too chargeable to the Church, and thus freely the one will do in communication to the other, and ſo walk together in a ſweet harmony of God, not compelling one another, but to ſerve each other in love. And again whereas you ſay, <hi>That Tithes are not typical, nor repealed.</hi> I doubt not but I ſhall prove them both typical, and repealed; and firſt, that they are typical, we may ſee the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth affirm to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in theſe words,
<note place="margin">Heb. 7.9.</note> 
               <hi>And as I may ſo ſay, Levi alſo who received Tithes, paid Tithes in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, for he was yet in the loins of Abraham, when Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedeck met him.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that the Tenth, or Tythes properly belong to Chriſt, which was the Antitype of <hi>Melchizedeck;</hi> but now to prove that Tyths are typical, and that ſuch as receive them, or ſuch as pay them, deny Chriſt nailed to the Croſs.

            <p>And ſo I am come to your laſt Argument, as touching In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Baptiſm,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2, 3.</note> the which I draw from the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>and were by nature the children of wrath as well as others; the Baptiſers</hi> (ſay you) <hi>ſay, the Text cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them children of Wrath, onely who walked in ſinful and evil courſes; but I anſwer,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that that expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition giveth the Text the lye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, and ſay, you are much miſtaken in what you ſay, for nature is that which leadeth from ſin, &amp; not to ſin, &amp; thoſe that are not lead by it and do not obey it; it will plead guilty and lay them under wrath; and that it leadeth from ſin, and not to ſin, ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.26 &amp; 2.14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Gal</hi> 4.8. But becauſe I have anſwered this Text once and again, in my former Treatiſe, I ſhall be brief at preſent, and ſay that nature in its region (as I may ſay) is pure, although it teacheth not the Myſteries of the Goſpel, yet it is able to teach men to live purely according to the Law, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The Gentiles that have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law, theſe are a Law to themſelves,</hi> &amp;c. From whence you may ſee, nature leadeth from ſin, to do things that are Holy, Juſt and Good, and not to do that which is evil, but if perſons that have no other Law to guide as the <hi>Epheſians</hi> had not before converſion, and yet ſin againſt it that will lay them under wrath; and ſo it came to paſs that the Apoſtle ſaith, they by nature were the children of wrath as well as others; and ſo briefly thus, as a man is a Malefactor by the Law of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when he hath broken the Law, ſo were theſe <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi> by nature (having tranſgreſſed againſt it) the children of wrath, that is, nature convicted them, and lay them under wrath; and this is the meaning of the Text, as you

            </p>

               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It argueth the truth of the practiſe of it never the more, for being near the Apoſtles time; unleſs you could prove it to be practiſed by the Apoſtles, for we are not ignorant of this one thing, that there was falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines crope in to the true Church in the primitive time, and therefore likely it was that falſe doctrine, ſhould be broached in the world; and therefore I ſay, that they are the onely wiſe men, that drink not onely near, but at the fountain head, that is, to take the practiſe of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, to be their pattern; and ſo I ſhall paſs from this particular, with ſome Arguments to prove, that Inſants are not the ſubjects, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles Baptiſed, or appointed to be Baptiſed, and firſt to the firſt.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> There is ſeveral wayes I might reply to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
<note place="margin">There was not a ſtate of a ſecond life or immorality in Pnradice; and therefore it cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be reſtored, but brought to light that which before was not.</note> and firſt; That the <hi>Minor</hi> never can be proved, (that is, that Chriſt reſtored Eternal life) the text ſaith, <hi>He abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light;</hi> the ſum of that is no more, but a ſtate of Reſurrection made known to the ſons of men; and in this you fight with your own ſhadow; Again ſecondly, the queſtion that is between you and I, is, whether <hi>Adam</hi> loſt a Heavenly Paradice, and purchaſed a ſecond death in the lake of fire and brimſtone; the which I ſay he did not, neither had he an heavenly Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice before the fall, neither could he purchaſe a ſecond death, unleſs he had ſinned againſt a ſecond life, the which he did not. And thirdly, I do affirm, that had not <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, he ſhould not have dyed but lived in that earthly Paradiſe, the which life in a ſence had been Eternal, if he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:118963:26"/>had not dyed, and when he had ſinned then had not Chriſt brought life, and immortality to light, we had dyed and been like water ſpilt upon the ground and never come to a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and ſo in a ſence it had been Eternal death; but this is that you ſhould have proved, (if you had intended to touch me) that <hi>Adam</hi> had a promiſe of Heaven before his fall, and that by his fall he loſt it, and purchiſed a ſecond death, the which your Argument toucheth not.</p>
            <p>And whereas you tell me the opinion of Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> (and I know not who,) it is nothing to me what their opinion is; it is proof of Scripture for what you affirm that I look for, and without it your words (or theirs) is nothing; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let me tell you, that Eternal life and immortality dwelt in the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and not in the firſt.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ſay; <hi>That</hi> Adam <hi>had an incluſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Eternal life, by eating of the free of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That tree God did appoint him to eat of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was life, or preſervation of life comprehended in it; but was then that tree, that which you call <hi>Adams</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life? If ſo, then it will be eaſily granted, that he loſt that for a time; but that the tree of life, was a type of Chriſt, that will be denied, becauſe when the ſubſtance is come then the ſhadow will flie away; upon that account Chriſt being become our life, or when we do enjoy eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life,
<note place="margin">The tree of life not a type of Chriſt or Eternal life, onely a main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a natural life in Paradice, <hi>Adam</hi> was not Spiritual in his innocency, but ſhall be in the time of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a Spiritual body like Chriſt. (<hi>mark that</hi>)</note> the ſhadow, (<hi>viz.</hi> the tree of life) muſt flie away; my meaning is, there muſt not be uſe made of him, the which there will be at that time, when we live Eternally as the Scripture hath ſaid; and if not, then Chriſt would not reſtore all things to his people that was loſt by <hi>Adam;</hi> both theſe the Scripture will prove:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That all things ſhall be reſtored unleſs the Serpent and diſobedient man, and alſo, that we ſhall eat of the tree of life in future, the which is no alligory, but ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled; the which ſheweth that the tree of life is not a type
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:118963:27"/>of Eternal life, becauſe they ſhall be enjoyed together, the which is not proper in types: And ſo I paſs, onely ſaying thus: Whereas you charge me with agreeing with <hi>Papiſts;</hi> that you do agree with them in many things is plain, witneſs <hi>Baby-Baptiſm,</hi> nay you are a branch of that root, and your ſtanding in your Miniſtry is from thence; but more of that anon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you urgean Argument from <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment came by one</hi> (viz. Adam) <hi>to condemnation, and that Condemnation is not onely the firſt death, but alſo Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in hell,</hi> (ſay you.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> and firſt, the Text will not imply what you ſay, but readeth it Condemnation, and ſo forth; and the word Condemnation doth (in Scripture) mean onely the firſt death, in ſome places were it is uſed, as in the Goſpel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.40. where our Saviour was condemned to die, or in the Condemnation, <hi>one of the Malefactours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled him, the anſwer of the other,</hi> (which was penitent) <hi>was on this wiſe; doeſt thou not fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame Condemnation;</hi> that is, the ſame Condemnation that Chriſt was in? the which I think no ſober man will think it was a damnation into hell, (<hi>viz.</hi> the ſecond death) but he was in a condemnation to a death, the which was the firſt death equivolent with <hi>Adams</hi> death for that ſin in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; and the ſame that is ſpoken of in <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.18. agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Luk</hi> 23.
<note place="margin">Theſe words uſed in both places, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Luk. 23.40 &amp; Rom. 5.18. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>adverb.</hi>
               </note> 40. <hi>Luke</hi> reads it thus, <hi>Condemnation,</hi> the very ſame word with the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. and yet as I have ſaid, no ſober man will think, that the condemnation ſpoken by <hi>Luke,</hi> is a condemnation to the ſecond death; and as the word is the ſame in our language that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. with <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.40. So it is the very ſame in the Greek Teſtament, and alſo in the Latine, ſee <hi>Luk</hi> 23.40. &amp; <hi>Rom</hi> 5.18. the Greek in both places readeth it <hi>Krima.</hi> or <hi>Katakrima</hi> adverb. and in the Latine, ſee Luk. 23.40. <hi>Damnatione;</hi> and Rom. 5.18. <hi>Condemnationem</hi> adverb; it is one and the ſame word: ſo that you may as well ſay, that Chriſt was in the condemnation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death, as ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> was in condemnation of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118963:27"/>ſecond death; for that ſin in Paradiſe, the words being one and the ſame: But now I ſhall clearly ſhew you that the condemnation ſpoken of, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. is not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to the ſecond death; the Argument to prove it is thus:</p>
            <p>If that death that entred in to the world by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, paſſed upon all, and reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> then it could not be the ſecond death; But that death which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin paſſed upon all, and rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes; Ergo,</hi> that death could not be the ſecond death: there is only the ſequel of the <hi>Major</hi> that may be queſtioned, the which I thus prove: if there were many that lived between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> which the ſecond death paſſed not upon, nor reigned over, then it could not be the ſecond death that entred into the world, and paſſed upon all,
<note place="margin">The ſecond death paſſed not upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that lived between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> but that death that entred into the world by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, paſſed upon all; which ſheweth it was not the ſecond death.</note> and reigned over them as beforeſaid; But there was many that lived between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſed not upon, not reigned over; <hi>Ergo,</hi> that death which entred into the world as before ſaid, was not the ſecond death: The <hi>Minor</hi> of this Argument is clear, that there were many that lived between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the ſecond death had no power of, (that is) it paſſed not upon, or reigned over them, as <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſeveral others, the which clearly ſheweth, that the death that entred into the world by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, was not the ſecond but the firſt death, and that paſſed upon all, even <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the reſt, they all dyed the firſt death, as they were duſt, ſo to duſt they did return; and ſo I paſs to the next thing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, the which is; You would prove (if ye could,) <hi>That the fleſhly or mortal (part of) man, begetteth the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal part or Spiritual Soul of man;</hi> and withal, refer me to ſeveral Authors to prove it, and yet when you have all done, you lay down (the Cudgels as I may ſay before you have ſtruck a ſtroak) ſaying, <hi>but let us not look for the Souls Parentage on earth:</hi> But if the Spiritual Soul be begotten by our Parents, then it is eaſie to finde our Souls Parentage on earth: And whereas we are ſaid to be all of the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118963:28"/>of God, it reſpecteth the Spiritual Soul, for God is the Father of Spirits, no man was yet called the Father of Spirits; <hi>we have Fathers of our fleſh,</hi> as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>which chaſtiſeth us, and we are in ſubjection unto them, ſhall we not much rather be in ſubjection to the Father of Spirits?</hi> There is Fathers of fleſh, and Fathers of Spirits oppoſed one to another, but man is not any where called the Father of Spirits.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ask me, Whether <hi>Man do not beget as compleat a creature, as the Beaſts do in their kinde? did not</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>beget a ſon in his own likeneſs, (meaning in ſin,</hi> ſay you.)</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, and firſt, That man doth begot a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect creature, and yet but mortal, for you your ſelves have granted it; for firſt ſay you, <hi>by his ſins he became mortal;</hi> ſaying, <hi>a mortal ſtomack could not feed upon immortal food,</hi> citing Doct, <hi>Halls</hi> contemplations; and ſay you, <hi>Adam</hi> begat a ſon in his own likeneſs: to the which I ſay, it was a poor mortal creature, for if Adam had begot the a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Soul, which is immortal, he had begat ſon partly in the likeneſs of God, but that man and beaſt probigate alike, and have one breath, (conſidered barely as man) read <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.18, 19, in theſe words, <hi>I ſaid in my heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the eſtate of the ſons of men, that God might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt them, and that they might ſee that they themſelves are beaſts, for that which befalleth the ſons of men-befalleth beaſts; even one thing befalleth them, as the one dyeth, ſo dyeth the other, yea they have all one breath; ſo that a man hath no preheminency above a beaſt, for all is vanity, all go to one place, all are of the duſt, and ſhall return to duſt again.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that man conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as of himſelf, there is no difference between him and the beaſt, onely there is ſomething that is in man, which is not of or from man, the which maketh him to differ, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Soul in Scripture, is frequently taken for the mortal part as in the book of <hi>Joſhua;</hi> and ſo Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>to pour out his Soul to death,</hi> and <hi>made his Soul an offering for ſins:</hi> But when you write again, ſhow what it is that is the Soul, and what it conſiſteth of.</p>
            <pb n="43" facs="tcp:118963:28"/>
            <p> And whereas you tell me a ſtory, of <hi>Levi paying of Tithes in Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> it was imputed to <hi>Levi,</hi> becauſe the matter that <hi>Levies</hi> body did conſiſt of,
<note place="margin">Job 31.15. Zach. 12.1.</note> ſprang from the loins of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> but it is the Lord that formeth and faſhioneth us in the womb, and createth the Spirit or Soul in us; that which <hi>Abraham</hi> did, was imputed to <hi>Levi,</hi> becauſe it might teach us, that there was a time that Tithes was to be taken from <hi>Levi</hi> and given to Chriſt, or that of proper right Tithes doth belong to Chriſt; as I have already hinted at.</p>
            <p>Again, You charge me with one errour worſe then <hi>Pila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> that is, becauſe <hi>I deny</hi> (as you ſay) <hi>that children were loſt, or indangered to be Eternally loſt in Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Adam</hi> and all his poſterity was in danger to be loſt in the duſt, had not Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them in delivering from the power of the grave.</note> and ſay, (in your ſenſe) I do deny that children were loſt, or in danger to be loſt in <hi>Adam;</hi> that is to ſay, to be loſt as men now ſhall be loſt that die in their ſins, namely to die the ſecond death in the lake of fire and brimſtone; but I do beleeve that children were in danger to be loſt as in the firſt death; that is, if Chriſt had not come and ſaved us and them from the ſting of death, which is the power of the grave, we had been kept there, and for ever had been deprived from the preſnce of God, and the Holy Angels, and been like water ſpilt upon the ground; and thus they were in danger to be loſt, from whence Chriſt hath ſaved all men, for he is the Saviour of all men but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of them that beleeve; and thus we all were in danger to be loſt by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin in Paradice, but to be loſt in your ſenſe by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, that I poſitively deny, and I know (or am fully perſwaded) there is not a man under the Sun that can prove it from the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Again, in your fourteenth page, you ſeem to hint at this, <hi>That Adam had the promiſe of Eternal life upon his obedience.</hi>
               <note place="margin">That natural life that God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice was a free gift and not upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, that the life which God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> in paradice was free without condition in reſpect of the gift of it, for God breathed him the breath of life, and put him into his inheritance freely, and afterwards telleth him what he ſhould do there, and alſo ſheweth him, that if he did ſin and tranſgreſs his Law, that then he muſt die the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118963:29"/>death; God never told <hi>Adam,</hi> that if he would obey him, that there was a further life and happineſs in future to be enjoyed; but ſheweth, that the life that then he did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, (the which was but a natural life) ſhould be taken from him, and the like.</p>

            <p>Again, I paſs to the Examination of what you ſay, to my alledged Argument, (paſſing your other diſcourſe) that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118963:30"/>of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>The Soul that ſinneth ſhall die.</hi> I have made a difference between <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and ours, as well as the puniſhment; that is, <hi>Adams</hi> ſin as he was natural and not ſpiritual, ſo his ſin brought death upon the natural part, but the ſon is not diſabled in reſpect of the Soul, by his Fathers ſin, but the Soul that ſinneth ſhall die; but the Argument that I did urge, is this:</p>
            <p>That no defiled creature is fit, or can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; But children in their non-age are fit for the Kingdom of Heaven; Therefore, children not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
            <p>To which you anſwer thus, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (ſay you) <hi>is taken two wayes; firſt, the Kingdom of Heaven is taken for the Kingdom of Grace, as</hi> Mark. 9.1. <hi>and</hi> Math. 11.12. <hi>There are ſome that ſtand here, that ſhall not taſte death till the Kingdom of God come in power: till Chriſtened Churches gathered, Ordinances adminiſtred, and children of beleeving Parents belong to this Kingdom, though ſuch as you, barr them from the Ordinances of the Kingdom of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, and ſay, in what you affirm, there is theſe two things mainely to be conſidered: the firſt is, that the Kingdom mentioned (Mark 9.1. in theſe words; <hi>There be ſome that ſtand here, that ſhall not taſte of death, till they have ſeen the Kingdom of God come with power;</hi>) is the Kingdom of Grace, to wit, the Goſpel Church, and Ordinances; And ſecondly, children are fit for that Kingdom, (as you ſay) but the queſtion is, whether we may beleeve you or not, but upon Examination, I ſhall prove it to be a falſe doctrine. And firſt to the firſt, That the Kingdom coming in power, is not meant of the Goſpel Church, or Ordinances, but of the power and glory of the Church triumphant agreeing with, or being the ſame with the words of <hi>Matthew,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16.22.</note> the which are thus read, <hi>Verily, Verily I ſay unto you, there be ſome ſtanding here, which ſhall not taſte if death till they ſie the Son of man coming in his Kingdom.</hi> Now that this is not a Goſpel Church, or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, which is called the Kingdom of God coming in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118963:31"/>power, or the Son of man coming in his Kingdom, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, becauſe it is no where ſo called. Secondly, if he had meant the Goſpel Church, or Ordinances, he need not have ſaid, <hi>Some of them that ſtand here ſhall not taſte of death, till the Kingdom of God come in power;</hi> or more properly the Son of man coming in his Kingdom; becauſe none of them that ſtood there did taſte of death, till they ſaw the Goſpel Church, and Ordinances, unleſs <hi>Judas Iſcariot;</hi> but I ſhall ſhew moſt evidently, that it is not meant of the Goſpel Church, and Ordinances coming, but of Chriſts coming in Glory; But (by the way) it is poſſible you will ſay, <hi>What then is not all the Apoſtles dead?</hi> I might ſay ſomewhat to it, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit they were all dead many hundred years ago, yet there was ſome that did not taſte of death till they ſaw Chriſt come in his Glory; But that neither <hi>Mark</hi> or <hi>Matthew,</hi> will carry it to the Goſpel Church, read that which goeth before the Text, and that which followeth the Text, you will finde the Text it ſelf meaneth, not the Goſpel Church, and Ordinances, as you ſay, ſee <hi>Mat</hi> 16.27, 28. compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 17.1, 2, 3, 4. compared with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.16, 17 in theſe words, <hi>For the Son of man ſhall come in the Glory of his Father, with his Angels, and then he ſhall reward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man according to his works: Verily, Verily I ſay unto you there be ſome ſtanding here, that ſhall not taſte of death, till they ſee the Son of man coming in his Kingdom. And after ſix dayes, Jeſus took Peter, James and John his brother, and bringeth them into a high mountain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and was transfigured before them, and his face did ſhine as the Sun, and his Rayment was white as the light. And behold there appeared unto them Moſes and Elias, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with him; then anſwered Peter and ſaid to Jeſus, Lord it is good for us to be here,</hi> &amp;c. From whence we may ſee, that it was not meant of a Goſpel Church, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauces, coming in power and Glory, when he ſpeaketh of the Kingdom of God coming in power; but the meaning ning of the place is, that ſome of his diſciples ſhould ſee the manner of his coming in the Glory of his Father &amp; that you may ſee alſo more plainly manifeſted, to be meant as before

I ſhall paſs ſaying nothing to it, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Text in it ſelf is true, although it be not for your purpoſe, but I commend you in that you gave no interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, becauſe to beſure you have not abuſed it, as you did the Text the which you did interpret.</p>

               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> You have done well in ſparing of your ink and paper in it, and if you had ſpared your pains, in other places, you had done well, for I ſtand not in admiration of men, becauſe I know <hi>men of high degree are vanity, and men of low degree are a lie;</hi> and therefore <hi>to the Law and the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to that, it is becauſe there is no light in them;</hi> and becauſe you have uſed an Argument, to prove, that <hi>Eſau</hi> was hated before he was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118963:34"/>born, I ſhall (thorow the ſtrength of my God) trace it, and anſwer it; the Argument is as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If God did not hate Eſau before he was born, but after, then he loved him before he was born; But he loved him not:</hi> 1. <hi>Becauſe that would argue a change in God, to love and hate the ſame perſon; ſecondly, the ninth of the Romans ſaith, God had a purpoſe about them, before they Wire born,</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>Was that purpoſe to love Eſau or hate him? If be loved him, how could he without change hate him? I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive afterward God hated him; Therefore in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood before he was born, for Gods decree is poſitive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, he calleth things that are not as if they were,</hi> Rom. 4.17. <hi>he ſaw him condemned before born, for Gods decrees depends not on man; How came Malichy to quote that place of</hi> Gen. 25, <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>to quote both, if not to one purpoſe.</hi> (Me thinks that when you urge Arguments your ſelf; and omit telling of ſtories of this and the other mans opinion, I like to trace you:) and firſt to the firſt;</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>That if God ſhould love Eſau before he was born, and hate him afterwards, it argueth a change in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Firſt, I ſhall prove that God doth hate ſuch as he hath loved; and ſecondly I ſhall ſhew how his decree run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from the two excellent properties, or attributes of God; namely, Juſtice and Mercy, which are (as I may ſay) thoſe main attributes upon which the other do depend; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be a ſweet harmomy, and correſpondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all God attributes; but to the firſt aſſertion: that is, God hateth that which he hath loved, and yet his decree unalterable;
<note place="margin">God once loved the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels but now hated them.</note> God did once love the Angels, which now he hateth, the which I thus prove: If all that God created, or made, was very good, and God alwayes loveth that which is good, then God loved the Angels which now he hateth; But all that God created or made, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good, and alwayes loveth that which is good; <hi>Ergo,</hi> God once loved the Angels which now he hateth: The Argument is undenyably true, and not to be excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. Firſt I think no man will deny that God made the Angels, and alſo that God being goodneſs it ſelf, could not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118963:34"/>make any thing evil,
<note place="margin">God which is goodneſs it ſelf cannot make any evil thing, but all very good, and that which is very good he loveth.</note> for when the whole Hoſt of Heaven, and earth was made, loe it was all very good; and if you ſhould doubt whether God loveth all that is good, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will prove it; &amp; alſo a principal of reaſon will teach us the ſame, he that which is good loveth all that is of the ſame nature, and God which is good cannot but love that which is good, and of the workmanſhip of his own hands. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, God wil not let that which is evil dwel in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but the Angels did dwel in his preſence, till they had made themſelve; evil by ſinning againſt God; and that the Lord loved the Angels before they ſinned is clear, the Text doth imply ſo much, for <hi>if God ſpared not the Angels that ſinned;</hi> implying if God would have ſpared any that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin, it would have been the Angels which was ſuch glorious creatures, and in ſuch a glorious eſtate; (but from hence we may learn, what evil and miſery ſin purchaſeth, which might forewarn us from ſin) and alſo, as I think, we may be eaſily perſwaded, that God once loved them; we may as well be perſwaded that God now hateth them, without uſing any Argument; for doubtleſs God hateth ſuch as he hath prepared the lake of fire and brimſtone for, the which is for fallen Angels; and ſo I paſs, although I could ſay very much of the loins of <hi>Adam,</hi> but becauſe there is an uſual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; <hi>viz</hi>

            <p>That it doth not argue a change in Gods decree, to love and hate one and the ſame perſon, becauſe the decree of God concerning men, as tou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hing Salvation or Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſpecteth not the perſon of a man, but the quality of a man; ſo that if God love, and hate the ſame perſon,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:118963:35"/>it is not becauſe God changeth, but becauſe man changeth; and that God doth not reſpect the perſon, but the quality; I ſhall prove from Scripture: And then ſecondly, ſhall ſhew alſo, in what line the decree of God runneth, both as touching Election, &amp; Reprobation: And thirdly, ſhall ſhew, that Gad doth decree to change the diſpenſation of Mercy, or Juſtice, according to the creatures acting.</p>
            <p>And firſt to the firſt, that is; God reſpecteth not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but the quality; &amp; that you may ſee it clearly proved, weigh the Scriptures in the ballance of your underſtanding; <hi>And Peter opened his mouth and ſaid,</hi>

            <p>And ſecondly,

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:118963:36"/>Gods decree, That of old he did ordain godly men to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ungodly men to Damnation; and ſo if men walke righteouſly in Chriſt, (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſts Commands) then the decree of Salvation doth reach them, or comprehend them; and if they turn from righteouſneſs to live in ſinful courſes, then the decree of Condemnation reacheth, or comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them: So that God changeth not, but it is man that changeth, for Gods decree is, to ſave righteous men, and deſtroy wicked men, not looking at this man or the other mans perſon, but as he findeth them righteous, or unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, unto which his decree hath reſpect; I pray admit of this compariſon, preſuppoſe we in this Country, were all rebells to his Highneſs the <hi>Lord Protector,</hi> and he being a man of great pitty; maketh a decree (although he might cut us off for our rebellion) to pardon us, if we caſt down our armes and ſubmit to him within twenty dayes; or otherwiſe, we ſhall periſh by the ſword, or the like; poſſibly ſome of us upon that account, caſt down our armes at ten dayes end, and then we are comprehended within the decree of Abſolution; but poſſibly by reaſon of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions that ſcoff at us, and call us cowards, and the like, we at fifteen dayes end, take up our armes again, and then we are comprehended within the Decree of Death; not that his Highneſs decree changeth, but it is by our changing that we are under the decree of Abſolution, or Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and although compariſons run not upon four wheels, (as we ſay) yet this compariſon reacheth the manner of Gods decree, or is a plain ſimilitude of it; and that it is ſo, read the Scriptures ſeriouſly, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the 18.21. and 26. in theſe words, <hi>But if the wicked ſhall turn from all his ſins, that he hath committed,</hi>

            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:118963:36"/>
            <p> That although God change not in what he hath abſolutely decreed, yet God hath decreed to change his diſpenſation of Mercy or Miſery, according to the creatures obedience, or diſobedience;</p>
            <p>And firſt,
<note place="margin">Jer. 18.7, 8, 9, 10.</note> ſee the words of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>In what inſtant I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Nation, or a Kingdom, to pluck up and pull down, and deſtroy it; If that Nation againſt whom I promunce, turn from their evil; I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them; And it what inſtant I ſpeak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom, to build and to plant it, If it do evil in my ſight, that it obey not my voice, then will I repent of the good that I ſaid I would benefit them withal.</hi> The very ſame you may ſee concerning the houſe of <hi>Eli</hi> in
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.30</note> theſe words, <hi>Wherefore the Lord God of Iſrael ſaith, I ſaid indeed, that thy houſe and the houſe of thy Fathers, ſhould walk before me for ever; but now the Lord hath ſaid, be it far from me, for them that honour me I will honour, and they that deſpiſe me, ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> And hence it came to paſs,
<note place="margin">Jonah 3.10.</note> that <hi>Nineveh</hi> was not deſtroyed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lord commanded <hi>Jona</hi> to cry, forty dayes and <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed;
<note place="margin">God did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to change the diſperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mercy, or Juſtice, according to the creatures obedience or diſobedience.</note> And <hi>God ſaw their works that they turned from their evil wayes, and God repented (viz.</hi> changed his mind) <hi>of the evil that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> had ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi> Hence we may ſee, that God changeth the diſpenſation of Mercy and Juſtice, according to the creatures acting; for he ſaid, <hi>Elies</hi> houſe ſhould abide, or be eſtabliſhed before him, but becauſe <hi>Eli</hi> preferred his ſons above Gods ſacrifice, ſuffering them to kick againſt it, cauſed the Lord to toot him up. And again, whereas God did ſay, he would deſtroy <hi>Nineveh,</hi> they humbling themſelves, the Lord did not doe unto them in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as he ſaid he would. And thus I have proved the three particulars, and fully anſwered what you have ſaid; namely, That to love and hate <hi>Eſau,</hi> you dargue a change in God; and ſo I p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Jacob have I loved, but Eſau have I hated.</hi> For the very ſame cauſe, that the Lord hated <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and caſt them out, and calleth them the people of his wrath; for the ſame cauſe, he hated <hi>Eſau;</hi> And that he hated <hi>Eſau</hi> for his ſin, and not before he was born, ſee <hi>Amos</hi> 1.11. <hi>Obad.</hi> 6.9, 10, 11, 15. <hi>How are the things of Eſau ſought out? thy mighty men O Teman ſhall be diſmayed, to the end that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the mount of Eſau might be cut off by ſlaughter, for the violence againſt thy brother Jacob; Shame ſhall cover thee and thou ſhalt be cut off for ever: Thou ſhouldeſt not have looked upon thy brother, in the day that he became a ſtranger, as thou haſt done, it ſhall be done unto thee, thy reward ſhall return upon thy own head.</hi> From whence we may ſee <hi>Eſau</hi> was hated for his evil, and not before he was born.

<note place="margin">The thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting is ſometimes called by the name of the thing repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</note> yet every particular doth not include a general: Therefore this inſtance not worth ſpeaking to, and yet I may ſay that in Cods account he was really offered up in a burnt offering, for God gave ſome what in his room to be a ſacrifice, when he ſaw <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> willingneſſe to obey his voyce, and it might be as well called <hi>Iſaac,</hi> as the Bread and Wine is called Chriſts Body,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:118963:42"/>and blood, becauſe God ſometimes calls the thing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth by the name of the thing repreſented; but the Lamb did repreſent <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſacrificed, and ſo might bear the name: there is ſeveral inſtances that might be further to the anſwer of this, but as I ſtuddy brevity, ſo its not worth my paines, and therefore I paſs to the next thing, which is:</p>
            <p>You ſay, <hi>That all though God would have all men to be ſaved, the which you conclude is but all ſorts,</hi> and ſo paſs on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with a ſmall glance to it.</p>
            <p>I anſwer and ſay, that you are as much miſtaken in that, as in the reſt of what you have ſaid, and therefore I ſhall brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, that it is every perſon that God would have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>The Argument is, If God would not have his Miniſters preach a lye in his Name to any man, and yet muſt preach Remiſſion of ſins, and Gods love to all men thorow Chriſt, then God would have every man to be ſaved;
<note place="margin">God would not have his Miniſters preach a lye to any man, yet he would have them preach love, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins to all men.</note> But God would not have his Miniſters preach a Lye to no man, and yet muſt preach Remiſſion of ſins, and Gods love to every man thorow Chriſt; <hi>Ergo,</hi> God would have every man to be ſaved: To prove this Argument, firſt, that he would have his Miniſters preach truth, and not a lye, I ſuppoſe none will deny; and ſecondly, it is plain that the Goſpel muſt be preached to every Creature, (namely the Creature Man) and I alſo am perſwaded that no man will deny the Goſpel to be Remiſſion of ſins, and Gods love in Chriſt; to wit, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to ſinners, not imputing their ſins: now if God did not intend to ſave all men, then in commanding the Goſpel to be preached to every man, commandeth a lye to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the greateſt part of men, the which were blaſphemy to ſay: if God would have all ſaved, that Chriſt dyed for, and Chriſt dyed for every man, then God would have every man to be ſaved; But God would have all ſaved that Chriſt dyed for, and Chriſt dyed for every man; <hi>Ergo,</hi> God would have every man to be ſaved; and that God would have all that Chriſt dyed for to be ſaved, you will not deny; and that Chriſt dyed for every man, I prove theſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118963:42"/>two wayes: Firſt, by a plain Text without controverſie, which ſaith, that <hi>he by the grace of God taſted death for every Man and Woman.</hi> Secondly, I ſhall urge this argument; If Chriſt dyed for ſuch is are ſaved, and ſuch as periſh, then he dyed for every man; But he dyed for ſuch as are ſaved, and ſuch as periſh; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he dyed for every man: That he dyed for them that periſh, ſee 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 2. there are ſome ſaid to have ſwift deſtruction,
<note place="margin">The Apoſtle Peter ſaith, that ſuch as bring on themſelves ſwift deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, were bought by the Lord.</note> ſo lowing them that deny the Lord that bought them, and from thence we may ſee that ſome that were bought by Chriſt (our <hi>LORD</hi>) did deny him: and that he bought or purchas'd with his blood, is clear from 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. and ſo I paſs from this to the next, (which is,) the Text 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3 9. thus read, <hi>But his long ſuffering to us-wards, is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> your anſwer is, <hi>that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Saints, and he loved us, and tells them why God was ſo ſlack in coming to judge the wicked, why ſo patient, and that Gods long ſuffering to us-ward, (not the wicked) is not willing that any, to wit, of us the Elect ſhould periſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I Reply, and ſay, and firſt, that to ſay <hi>Peter</hi> wrote to Saints, and beloved, is true; but to ſay, where he ſpeaketh of Gods long ſuffering to us, not willing that any ſhould periſh, me aneth Saints, I deny; then you will poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) ask me who then the Apoſtle means when he ſaith, <hi>his long ſuffering to us, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but all ſhould come to repentance.</hi>

            <p>Anſwer firſt, I ſhall ſhew you who it is not, and then I ſhall ſhew you who it is; and firſt who it is not: it is not the Saints there meant, becauſe in Gods for bearing, or delaying his coming conduces to the Elects hurt, &amp; not to their good, and Chriſt hath ſaid, the days ſhal be ſhortned for their ſakes, but never ſaith he will forbear, or be ſlack, or defer, or ſuffer long for their ſakes, for as God will haſten the time for their ſakes, ſo it cannot come too ſoon to them for they then ſhall lift up their heads; from whence you may ſee that it is not for the Elects ſake that God ſuff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Why doth he yet find fault, for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſheweth, that they had reſiſted his will by being marred in his hand under the means of Grace; or otherwiſe he ſaith nothing at all in anſwer to the Objection, for if <hi>Paul</hi> had been of your opinion (that is to ſay) if he had ſuppoſed that the will of God (in the tenderneſs of grace) were irreſiſtable, ſo as it could not be reſiſted, then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had no ground to make an Objection of that nature, becauſe he could never have (fairly) anſwered it: and that you may ſee it more evident, admit of this compariſon for illuſtration; ſuppoſe a man ſhould have two Sons, and it was the Fathers pleaſure to educate one Son very richly, and alſo to leave the other Son without any breeding, or educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, ſo that he could not carry (or) behave himſelf at all ſutable to his Father, in-ſo-much that he doth bring much diſhonour to his Father, the which cauſeth his Father to be much diſpleaſed with him ſo far as to diſ-inherit him for that diſhonour that he bringeth to him by his ill manners: Now if this Son ſhould object and ſay, Why doth my Father deal thus with me, to diſ-inherit me for my ill manners? who hath reſiſted his will? for was it not his will thus to educate me? therefore why doth he now find fault with me? it is true, it was in his power to educate me as he pleaſed, and foraſmuch as it was his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to educate me no better, who canreſiſt his will? why doth he now find fault becauſe my carriage and behaviour is no better, ſeeing I have not reſiſted his will? How any man can take off the objection, ſo as to dear the Father, and lay the fault on the Son, I know not; ſo in like manner, if God ſhould appoint perſons veſſels of wrath before they were born, and ſo with hold the education of his Spirit from them, and yet notwithſtanding be offended becauſe there behaviour to him was no better, if they ſhould ſay, why doth he find fault with us, (for ſo doing) for who hath reſiſted his will? for it was his will and pleaſure ſo to make us; how that, or ſuch a like Objection could be anſwered, I know not, although I doubt not but I know all (or in a great meaſure) what may be ſaid to it, for if the Apoſtle do only
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:118963:46"/>plead Gods prerogative over all creatures (as you ſay) that he cannot make them what veſſel he pleaſe, either to honor, or to diſhonour; and that it be his pleaſure to make ſome diſhonourable, yet ſtill the Objection lyeth unanſwered, <hi>Why doth he then find fault?</hi> (ſeeing he maketh them as he pleaſeth) <hi>who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> But as I have ſaid, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cleareth God, and proveth that they were the people that had reſiſted his will, by their putting eternal life away from them, and ſo were marred in his hand; and that God was juſt in making them diſhonourable, and caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out as before-ſaid, and thereby cleareth Gods Juſtice; and ſo I paſs to the next thing conſiderable, to wit, Gods power, that is; Whether God want Power, yea, or nay, becauſe it is a queſtion you ask?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, and ſay, That if we ſpeak only of Gods power, and not conſider his other Attributes, then I ſay, God hath not only power to ſave all <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and compell them to turn from all their iniquities, (from which he often fore-warned them, and dehorted them) and ſweareth that he hath <hi>no pleaſure in their death,</hi> but rather in their life, and cryeth, <hi>O that they would have hearkened unto my Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118963:46"/>to ſave the Wicked, but his Juſtice will not admit of it; he had power enough to redeem the World without blood, only his Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied; he had power enough to have cauſed <hi>Iſrael</hi> to have dwelt ſafely, and not to have been moved for all their ſins, but his Purity and Truth could not ſuffer it, for the word was gone forth of his mouth, <hi>That at what inſtant he ſpake of a Nation to build and to plant, if they did evill in his ſight, be would repent of the good that he had ſaid he would benefit them withall;</hi> and therefore he could not proſper <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they lived in their ſins, he had power enough to ſave <hi>Iſrael</hi> without, or beyond means: but his wiſdom, and good will, and pleaſure would not admit of it, becauſe his wiſdom, and good-will, and pleaſure was to ſave all thorow meanes, and he had power enough to make all their hearts of ſuch a temper, that they could not have reſiſted him: but it was Gods wiſdom ſo to diſpoſe of mans heart, that he had power enough to ſtand if he did improve it, and yet notwithſtanding he put him in ſuch a capacity, that he might fall if he took not good heed, to that end that he might ſee a want of daily ſupplies from God, and that he ſhould not be high-minded, (and ſol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">If God who is no reſpecter of perſons ſhould have ſeen all men fallen alike by one and the ſame guilt of tranſgreſſion, and have ſaved ſome, and left others in miſery, how had his mercy been above all his works?</note> it would have been a very great diſhonour to almoſt (if not) all the Attributes of God to have redeemed but part firſt, it would have argued weakneſs, or di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118963:47"/>or otherwiſe it would have deſtroyed the Attribute of his Mercy, ſo that his Mercy had not been over all his Works.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It would have deſtroyed his unſadomable, and univerſal goodneſs to the Sons of men, and made him a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecter of perſons, the which he hath declared againſt; for conſider, if when God ſaw all men in miſery, and all created and faſhioned alike by him, and all fell equal in one and the ſame guilt of tranſgreſſion; if God ſhould ſave ſome out of it, and leave others in it, (when all were made alike, and all had ſinned alike) would not God be a reſpecter of perſons, the which the Scripture plainly declareth againſt.</p>
            <p>Finally, it would preach ſuch a Doctrine as this, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God did command the Goſpel of Grace to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto all miniſterially, yet it never was intended to the greateſt part of men, but to be a Goſpel of miſery: for if it be only preached to leave men without excuſe, and that to take advantage of the moſt part of men, and to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate no good at all, then the Angels did not preach truth to the Shepheards, when they ſaid; <hi>It was glad tidings of great joy to all men;</hi> but if your opinion be true, the Goſpel was ſo far from being glad tidings of great joy to all men, that it was the worſt tidings that ever came, or was declared to the greateſt part of men, the truth hereof no rational man can deny, for if God never did intend in the tenderneſs of the Goſpel any good to thoſe that reject it, only intended it to leave them without excuſe, then theſe abſurdities muſt follow: Firſt, that God did not deal faithfully with the greateſt part of men, in offering that unto them that he never intended to give; but I ſay God forbid we ſhould be of ſo baſe an opinion, yea let God be true, and every man a lyar, and let every Chriſtian man ſay, with <hi>Abraham, ſhall the God of the whole earth do unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly:</hi> ſurely ſuch things cannot be found in him, and in ſaying ſo of the Lord, you make him like to hypocrites, and diſſemblers, the which abomination is ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orred of the Lord; I could ſpeak much to it, but I paſs to the ſecond, which is; If God never intended ſalvation to all men in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118963:47"/>derneſs of the Goſpel, then it is impoſſible for men in the ſlighting of the Goſpel to neglect their own Salvation, for if God never intended Salvation thorow the Goſpel to ſuch as reject it, as well as to thoſe that receive it, then thoſe that reject it reject nothing, for there was nothing intended them in it (if your opinion be true,) and therefore could reject nothing, neither could they neglect their own Salvation: for if Salvation was not intended in the Goſpel to ſuch as ſleep (away their time) in ſecurity, then they could not neglect it by their ſecurity, becauſe if they had been never ſo much induſtrious, yet it had added nothing unto them, becauſe Salvation was never intended them; and thus you excuſe men in their diſobedience, and reſiſting the Goſpel, and neglecting means of Grace and Salvation, although (in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) I judge you do it ignorantly: I could ſay much more, but I am neceſſitated to haſten, and come to the next thing, which is about <hi>Sodoms</hi> fire.</p>
            <p>The which ſay you, <hi>it will ſuffer much upon examination,</hi> becauſe I ſay it is not meant that lake of Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the which is called the Second death; but it is called eternal in oppoſition to ſuch fire as is called temporal, or may be ſo called, becauſe as it is kindled by man, ſo it is put out by man, the which that fire that deſtroyed <hi>Sodom</hi> was of another nature: it was not kindled by man, neither could it be extinguiſhed by man, and yet was no more hell fire than that which fell on the Captains, and their Fifties for their ſins; I could ſpeak much to it, but its not worth my time, only this queſtion reſolve when you Write again I pray you, where you learned ſuch a Doctrine? and what Reaſon you can give to prove it? that is, that after perſons are ſent to Hell, they muſt be brought back again to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be judged and tryed whether they deſerve it yea or nay? Is it legal for the Magiſtrates of a free Corporation to take a man and hang him, and then afterward to ſet down and determine the caſe, whether he have deſerved it yea or nay? Is this and ſuch like dealing, Gods merhod (O ye blind guides) did God caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice into the curſe, and afterwards brought him to Judgement, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

            </p>
            <p>To which I ſay there is not ſo much as a colour of truth in it (as I conceive,) and whereas the Text ſpeaketh of <hi>gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as priſoners into a pit, and after many dayes to viſit them.</hi> After he hath ſpoak of puniſhing them on the earth, therefore you conclude that the viſitation is after the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

<note place="margin">Rev. 20, 6, 7, 8.</note> yet I ſhall take it (for brevity ſake) as you have laid it down in yours; which is:</p>
            <p>That if <hi>Adam</hi> had decreed againſt him eternal death,
<label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>1</label> and all in his Lines upon his diſobedience, and that not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them, then is God changeable; But God changeth not; Therefore.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:118963:51"/>
            <p> Your Anſwer is,
<note place="margin">If Gods threatnings work not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, it breaks out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
               <hi>God never decreed that Adam and his ſhould eternally periſh,</hi> and yet you ſay that the death that God ſaid they ſhould dye (for that ſin committed in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice) was eternal death: now that death that God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to bring on <hi>Adam</hi> if he ſinned; he did decree to bring it on him, and accordingly did being it on him (and all his) the which death was only the firſt death, as I have already proved, and I am very confident that all the oppoſites in the world can never prove that it was the ſecond death, but read my <hi>Syons Redemption,</hi> and ſee your anſwer is no whit to the purpoſe; I have alſo ſhewed what is meant in the <hi>Epheſians, and were by nature the children of wrath as well as others;</hi> and whereas you ask me, whether <hi>Adams</hi> Fall was decreed, I Anſwer, God never did decree man ſhould ſin, God did fore ſee man would, but never did decree he ſhould: yet God did decree to ſend Chriſt ſeeing <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, we agree in this, that God did never intend or decree <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> eternal ruine, but did decree him to the duſt for that ſin, and when he had brought him there, his Juſtice was ſatisfied, and had God been onely Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and not mercy, there he muſt have hin for ever, their Juſtice to him, and their Mercy for him to bring ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from the dead, and ſo ſaith the Scripture, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.14. <hi>We muſt needs dye, and be like water ſpilt upon the ground</hi> (for God hath decreed it) <hi>yet he hath uſed a means that his baniſhed ſhell not be for ever expelled from him;</hi> and whereas you ſay, <hi>all School-men do allow of a concealed will, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will the former is unchangeable, not the latter,</hi> that is, his revealed will is changeable, <hi>Firſt, Becauſe God threatned Niniveh, Adam, and Hezekiah, and yet did not puniſh them ſo as he threatned. And ſecondly, commanded Pharoah to let Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael go, and Abraham to ſacrifice his Son, and her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> God chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his ſentence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, and firſt to the firſt that is, that Gods revealed will is changeable, the which if it be true (as you ſay) then although he have commanded us to obey the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and in ſo doing promiſed ſalvation, yet we know not whether he ſpeak as he means, or whether his mind will
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:118963:52"/>change yea or nay, this and much of this nature I might ſay which is your opinion of God, and how much leſs than bla ſphemy it is, I leave the Reader to judge of.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, as touching that of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> that when he told him that he ſhould dye and not live, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding added unto his dayes fifteen years, we know that God hath promiſed to turn away puniſhment from ſuch as humble themſelves before him; hence he ſpared <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he humbled himſelf, and much more will he ſpare his own people when they humble themſelves as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did, with tears, yet Gods will altereth not, though he do will to alter the diſpenſation of Mercy, or Juſtice, according to the Cretures obedience, or diſobedience, as already proved.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; As touching <hi>Niniveh,</hi> if God had deſtroyed them in forty dayes, according as he ſaid he would, God had been changeable in his Decree, conſidering their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<note place="margin">Gods will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he do will to change in diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mercy or Juſtice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the creatures o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience or diſobedience.</note> and Humiliation, for before God ſent <hi>Jonah</hi> to <hi>Niniveh</hi> to proclaim, <hi>yet forty dales and Niniveh ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,</hi> he had decreed and declared it that <hi>in what inſtant he ſpake of a people to deſtroy thon if that people againſt whom he pronounced, the judgement did repent, he alſo would repent of the evil that he ſaid he would bring upon them,</hi> and <hi>Nineveh</hi> did repent of their evill, and then if the Lord ſhould not have repented of the evil of puniſhment (that he ſaid he would bring on them,) then he had been changeable, that is, he had ſaid one thing and had done another; but Gods revealed will changeth not, although he do will to change as beforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And Fourthly, God did bring the full ſumme of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon <hi>Adam</hi> that he threatned, and more than we find Recorded, for all that was threatned, was that he ſhould dye, (or in dying he ſhould dye) the which is meant that he ſhould be in a dying condition from the time of his ſin, till he fell into the duſt from whence he was taken, and ſo in the midſt of liſe to be in death, or a dying condition till death, never continuing in one ſtay, but the earth being curſed for his ſake, we do not find there ended, yet we ſee it was in the ſentence, and alſo the Womans conception to be in ſorrow, the which are as Pendicts or appurtenances to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118963:52"/>death,
<note place="margin">Man is in a dying condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Womb till he falls into the duſt and hat is meant by the Lords threatning him, in dying thou ſhalt dye; Gen. 2.</note> all ſhewing Gods revealed will altereth not, and ſo I come to the ſecond Head, which is Gods commands, that is ſay you, <hi>God doth command men to do that in his revealed will the which in his ſecret will never intends they ſhould do: as firſt he commanded Pharoah to let Iſrael go; and ſecondly commanded Abraham to offer up Iſaac, and did not intend they ſhould do it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> And to the firſt, that is, <hi>God did command Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh to let Iſrael go, and yet did not intend he ſhould let them go.</hi> To which I ſay, God did intend that <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſhould let them go, although God knew that <hi>Pharoah</hi> at the firſt would not let them go; but Gods fore knowledge that men will do evill is not the cauſe that they do evil; God knew that <hi>Cain</hi> would ſtay <hi>Abel,</hi> yet he was not the cauſe of his ſo doing; But you will ſay that God hardened <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roahs</hi> heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> So he might juſtly do, as I ſhall ſhew the cauſe in the expoſition of the Ninth of the <hi>Romans</hi> if the Lord pleaſe, but that is not our queſtion; but our queſtion is, Whether God did intend <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſhould let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go? we argue no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the caſe whether he ſhould have let them go-ſooner or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but ſingly thus, whether <hi>Pharoah</hi> ſhould let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go? the which I do affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>me, that God did intend that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhould let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, and the Lord ſaid that he <hi>knew that he would let them go,</hi> although not at the firſt as you may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.19, 20. and if <hi>Pharoah</hi> had let them go at the firſt, be had not ſinned in ſo doing, yet it pleaſed God to ſhew to <hi>Moſes</hi> that he would harden his heart, bee uſe he had hardened himſelf againſt him, ſo that <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt not expect to go preſently, and yet the Lord ſheweth <hi>Moſes</hi> that he would ſo weary him with his ſignes, that he would make him willing to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go at the laſt, theſe two things obſerve.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That God intended when he had tryed <hi>Pharoah</hi> by his ſignes, that he ſhould let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, God did not harden <hi>Pharoahs</hi> heart on purpoſe to keep <hi>Iſrael</hi> from going, but becauſe <hi>Pharoah</hi> had ſlited the Lord in <hi>ſaying who is the Lord? I will not obey his voice, and let you go;</hi> that therefore
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118963:53"/>the Lord did harden <hi>Pharoah</hi> when firſt <hi>Pharoah</hi> had har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened <note place="margin">The Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Pharoah</hi> har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened his heart againſt the Lord.</note> himſelf, that he might know that the Lord was ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he. I might ſpend much time in running thorow the cauſes of things, but of that anon. And Secondly, take notice this was not Gods ſecret will, namely in appointing <hi>Pharoah,</hi> not to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go when he had commanded him to let them go, but it was his revealed will made known to <hi>Moſis</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and in the next place I come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the matter as touching Gods commanding of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> offering up <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and (ſo ſhall p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſs from this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the ſecond Argument) I ſhall be very brief, ſaying, that in a ſenſe as beforeſaid <hi>Abraham</hi> did offer up <hi>Iſaac;</hi> and alſo this is not a ſecret thing, becauſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, it was but to try <hi>Abraham</hi> as I have before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, therefore I paſs to the third Argument, (the ſecond you grant to be true.)</p>
            <p>And the third is, If <hi>Adam</hi> in his beſt condition (as he ſtood in Paradice before the fall) were but an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Adam</hi> In his beſt eſtate was but an earthly man.</note> man, and all his enjoyments earthly, then he could looſe no more then what he had to looſe, which was but earthly; but <hi>Adam</hi> in his beſt condition was and enjoyed but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; <hi>Ergo,</hi> all that he loſt was but earthly enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Your anſwer ſeems very weak in my opinion, which is (ſay you) <hi>All ſinned in Adam to condemnation, or damnation; and hence Inſants by nature are children of wrath, or otherwiſe</hi> (ſay you) <hi>what is meant by the Hebrew Text, in dying thou ſhalt dye.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, and firſt to the firſt, which is, <hi>All ſinned in Adam</hi> (ſay you) <hi>to condemnation:</hi> it is very true that for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin all men were condemned, for ſaith God <hi>Dust thou art, and to duſt thou ſhall return,</hi> meaning not only <hi>Adam,</hi> but all his Lines, and <hi>therefore it is appointed once for men to dye, for we muſt needs dye, and be like water ſpilt upon the ground,</hi> and as I have ſaid, the word condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will not help you, becauſe there is the very ſame in <hi>Luke</hi> 23.40 and yet it is only a temporal death; and ſo I am come to the next thing, which is:</p>
            <pb n="93" facs="tcp:118963:53"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>That Infants</hi> (ſay you) <hi>are children of wrath by nature.</hi> If you mean they are children of wrath as in reſpect to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward puniſhment we differ not, becauſe Gods Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied, for God thereupon to inflict it if he ſinned, but he did ſin therefore it muſt of neceſſity be puniſhed, otherwiſe Juſtice not ſatisfied, becauſe there was no Repentance given or required as in reference to that ſin, but if you ſuppoſe that Infants be children of wrath as in reſpect of puniſhment to the ſecond Death, we much differ, and I will give you ſeven years time to prove it, in which time prove it if you can.</p>
            <p>And whereas you ask me; what is meant by the Hebrew word, in dying thou ſhalt dye.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, (as beforeſaid) that ſo ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten he was in a dying condition, and ſo are all men dying untill they be dead, ſo that in the midſt of life we are in death, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing not in one ſtay, and ſo I come to examime what you ſay to my fifth Argument, which is:</p>
            <p>That opinion which (in the extent of it) will make the Devil to ſpeak true, and God to lye, is anabſurd blaſphemous opinion; but ſuch is the opinion that ſaith that the Death that God threatned to <hi>Adam</hi> was the ſecond Death, and yet that ſecond Death not inflicted for that ſin on <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Lines, ſo he ſaith God ſpeaketh falſely, and the Devil truth; <hi>Ergo,</hi> that opinion an obhor'd &amp; blaſphemous opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but the <hi>minor</hi> is falſe (as you ſay) for ſay you, <hi>Although God threatned Adam with eternal death, yet he lyed not in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting it becauſe his threatens was to dehort Adam from ſin, not his peremptory reſolution, but as to Hezekiah and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, you have ſaid nothing at all to prove my <hi>minor</hi> falſe for as I have ſaid that God did ſay, that if <hi>Adam</hi> did eat he ſhould dye, and that eternally (ſay you) but the Devill ſaid that he ſhould not dye, (<hi>viz,</hi> eternally) but <hi>Adam</hi> did eat; now if <hi>Adam</hi> and his Lines did nor ſo dye a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer (as beforeſaid) that is but to make the Devils words true, for God had ſaid and decreed they ſhould dye but the Devil perſwaded them (to believe a lye) that they ſhould not dye: &amp; that the Devil might be a true Prophet (ſay you) God ſent Chriſt that they might not dye; and as to the caſe of <hi>Nineveh</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> I have already anſwered; And again, whereas you would have me ſay <hi>Either Chriſt brought not juſtification of life by his obedience, or elſe conclude Adam brought evernal condemnation by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, or ſay there is no ſence in the Apoſtles arguing Rom.</hi> 5.18.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, there is good reaſon in the Apoſtles reaſoning, and yet his words imply not that which you would infer from them, for I have already proved that the condemnation there mentioned is but to the duſt, (<hi>viz.</hi> the firſt death:)

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:118963:54"/>to the power of the firſt death, ſo that the ſting of death did (as we may ſay) attach them, but mercy (through the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt) ſtepped in, and jus;tified man from that attachment, and deſtroyed the power of it, and brought life and immortality to light, for although God did peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily Decree that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould go to the duſt for that ſin, (<hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return</hi>) yet he did not decree (either in his threatning, or in his ſentence) that he ſhould lye there eternally, yet the ſting of Death, (<hi>viz.</hi> the power of the Grave) would have ſeized on, or ſurprized him, had not mercy in the Promiſe juſtified man from it, and thus the free gift came upon all men to juſtification of life.

               <p>Secondly, there is no coming to God in a Goſpel way, (ſo as will be acceptable to him) but by Faith, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, for he that cometh,

               <p>In this verſe there are theſe two things that are in chief treated to; the firſt is, Who it is that are not the children of God, and who that are; and firſt to the firſt, that is, who they are that are not the children of God, and that is the children of the fleſh, they are not the children of God, as ſaith the Apoſtle: from whence it is clear without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:118963:59"/>that the children of believers conſidered only as from their fleſhly deſcent without the work of grace, to wit, faith and regeneration wrought in the ſoul are not the children of God upon a Goſpel account, to wit, heirs of Goſpel-priviledges, for ſaith the Apoſtle, the children of the fleſh (meaning children of believers) are not the children of God; from whence we may ſee the fond conceit of a generation of men in our dayes that plead for birth-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges: but becauſe I have handled them in another place, I ſhall ſpare them here, and come to the ſecond thing conſiderable in this verſe; that is, Who they are that are the children of God upon a Goſpel account, and the Apoſtle reſolveth the queſtion, ſaying, <hi>The children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeed;</hi> and that we may alſo know who they are that are the children of the promiſe, the A po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle reſolves us in his words written to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> chap. 3. v 26, 27. ſaying, <hi>Ye are all the ſons of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus: for as many as haut been baptized unto Chriſt, have put on Chriſt, and if ye are Chriſts</hi> (as aforeſaid) <hi>then are ye Abrahams ſeed, and heirs according to promiſe;</hi> ſo then, that which this eight verſe teacheth us is this: firſt, that the children of believers (conſidered before their converſion,) upon a Goſpel account, are not the children of God, and ſo no right to Goſpel ordinances, (and yet if they dye in their Infancy, ſhall be ſaved, as I have diſcovered in my Treatiſe intituled, <hi>Dagon's Down fal before the Ark of the Lord.</hi>)</p>

                  <hi>Annot.</hi> This verſe is but a repetition of the fifteenth verſe (which ſaith, <hi>For he ſaid unto Moſes, I will have mercy in whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion</hi>) the which verſe I have explained or opened at large, ſhewing the occaſion of the Lords diſcourſe to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alſo who it is that God will have mercy and compaſſion on; and therefore ſhall paſſe this briefly, and ſay, that the Apoſtle in this verſe reaſons on this wiſe, as if he ſhould have ſaid, although it be ſo, that you O houſe of Iſrael be all branches from one and the ſame ſtock and root, yet by reaſon of your being degenerate plants and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruitfull, the Lord may cut you off, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, may ſpare part of the branches (although of the ſame ſtock or root) they being fruitfull, and may cut off and reject you that are unbelieving and unfruitfull, and this is the ſum and ſcope of the Apoſtles diſcourſe in this whole Chapter; as if he ſhould ſay, you houſe of Iſrael, think it no ſtrange thing that God ſhould ſave ſome of you, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject other ſome, and yet you being children of one father (according to the fleſh, <hi>viz. Abraham</hi>) for God looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no ſuch thing for if you were of a nearer relation to him, than of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed (even as a ſignet on his right
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118963:68"/>hand) yet if you ſin he will reject you (for all that near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) for he will have mercy on whom he will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and whom he will, he hardeneth; that is, he will have mercy on humble penitent repenting ſouls, and he will give up ſtubborn ſinners to hardneſſe of heart although they be the children of a father beloved of God, and alſo if <hi>Daniel, Noah</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> ſhould intreat for them (as <hi>Moſes</hi> did) ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, have mercy on theſe people and remember their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (<hi>viz.

               <p>Verſ. 19. <hi>Thou wilt ſay then unto me, why doth he yet finde fault, for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Annot.</hi> In this verſe (we may clearly ſee) the Apoſtle raiſeth an octjection the which he anſwereth in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verſes, the objection lyes in theſe words; <hi>why doth he yet finde fault, for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> As if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſhould have ſaid, peradventure you houſe of Iſrael may ſay to the Lord, for what cauſe doſt thou finde fault with us? who of us have reſiſted thy will (why wilt thou, or) for what cauſe wilt thou reject us? But the Apoſtles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them in order to clear God in his juſtice ſaith,</p>
               <p>Verſ. 20. <hi>Nay but O man, who art thou that replyeſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay unto him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Annot.</hi> In this verſe the Apoſtle doth as it were preface to the anſwer of the objection, but his full anſwer lyeth in the following verſe; but in this verſe he reaſons on this wiſe, as if he ſhould have ſaid, doſt thou ask why God finds fault with thee and puniſhes thee, &amp; who it is that hath reſiſted his will, as though thou was clear and innocent, and knew not why God had made thee a diſhonourable veſſel, and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, who art thou, or how
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:118963:68"/>canſt reply againſt God and ſay, why haſt thou made me thus a diſhonourable veſſel, for ſaith he, God did before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, that although he did intend to make you an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable people) that if you did harden your ſelves againſt your Maker and ſin againſt him, that then he would make you another veſſel as pleaſ'd him beſt, which without doubt would be a diſhonourable one, of this the Lord hath before preached to you by the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> when he made him go down to the Potters houſe &amp; ſee the work upon the wheel and the clay marred in the Potters hands,
<note place="margin">Jer. 18 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> and him making of it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther veſſel as ſeemed good to the Potter, at which time the word of the Lord came to <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſaying, As the Clay is in the Potters hands, ſo are ye O houſe of Iſrael in my hands, (<hi>therefore</hi>) in what inſtant I ſpeak of a Nation or Kingdom to build and to plant, if they do evill in my ſight, I will repent of the good that I ſaid I would benefit them withall; and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, do you ask why he doth finde fault with you and make you thus a diſhonourable veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, hath he not power ſo to do and that according to true juſtice, you being made in the hands of his mercy by your diſobed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Verſ. 21. <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the Clay of the ſame lump, to make one veſſel unto honour and another unto diſhonour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Annot.</hi> In this verſe the Apoſtle anſwereth the objection, as if he ſhould have ſaid, O houſe of Iſrael take notice of this, as the Potter had power over his clay (that is) when it was marred in his hand, otherwiſe to diſpoſe of it although at the firſt he did intend to make it an honourable veſſell; yet afterwards he had power and wiſdome otherwiſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of it (that is to ſay) to convert that which was ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and brittle to a diſhonourable veſſel, and that which was flexible and yielding to an honourable veſſell, and this is Gods power and priviledge over you, even you O ye
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:118963:69"/>houſe of Iſrael, you being marred in Gods hand, he may diſappoint you of that glory which he did intend to beſtow upon you as you were a Nation whom once the Lord loved and called his peculiar people, and yet might have mercy upon a ſmall remnant of that lump (or Nation) who did believe and were humble, yielding and penitent before the Lord. And thus the Apoſtle clears up Gods Juſtice: and thus I paſſe to the next verſe, becauſe thoſe things that might be offered as objections (to ſome particulars in this verſe) I have already anſwered in my precedent diſcourſe in this Treatiſe, and alſo the neceſſity of my preſent occaſion cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth me to ſtudy brevity.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 22. <hi>What if God willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power known, indured with much long ſuffering, the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Annot.</hi> In this verſe we may underſtand the Apoſtle ſheweth, that God had been juſt, if he had deſtroyed the Nation of the Jews long before for their rebellion, but for theſe two cauſes God did ſuffer long: The firſt is, becauſe he would make his power and wrath appear the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere toward that rebellious people, for our admonition and forewarning unto us. And ſecondly, that he might make known his mercy in a more larger manner and meaſure on that part of the houſe of Iſrael who did believe and fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, that they might ſay, it was of his mercy that we were not conſumed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But if it be objected and ſaid, that the Text ſaith. The veſſels of wrath are fitted to deſtruſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer and ſay, That as the receiving and cheriſhing of the gracious motions of Gods Spirit it ſits us or prepares us for glory, even ſo the receiving of the motions of ſin and cheriſhing of it fits us for deſtruction, and thus one part of Iſrael was fitted for deſtruction by their receiving ſin and Satan ſo as to be guided thereby, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſo was the other part or remnant fitted or prepared for glory thorough the receiving the motions of the Spirit of Chriſt, and being guided thereby, the which as it ſits for
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:118963:69"/>glory, ſo at laſt it brings us to glory, and ſo I paſſe to the next verſe, which is as followeth,</p>
               <p>Verſ. 23. <hi>And that he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, which he had before prepared unto glory.</hi>

                  <hi>Annot.</hi> I having opened this verſe before, I ſhall paſſe it briefly ſaying, that there is no ſoul that ever ſhall enjoy glory but ſuch as are fitted for it in this life, and that by the Lord. And ſecondly, I ſay that ſuch as periſh have been ſtrived with by the Spirit of God, that thereby they might have been fit for glory, but they would have none of his counſell, for they deſired not the knowledge of his wayes; and ſo I paſſe to the next verſe which is;</p>

And ſecondly, I ſhall be brief, becauſe, I ſuppoſe, that there be but few men but do or may know (if they ſearch the Scriptures) that your (kinde of) Election and ordination is not of God. Firſt, in reſpect of your Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery.

               <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, It would not have conduced much to my honour (before men) to prove your Calling and Ordination not to be of God) becauſe there be very few but know it (or may know it) if they ſearch the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and therefore no great piece of work, ſo as to be admired at, when all men may eaſily ſee it, if they ſhut not their eyes againſt the light.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:118963:79"/>my occaſion) to mention in particular, and therefore ſhall paſſe to the third and laſt thing, which is the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or method of Election and Ordination, together with the work contained in the Office, and becauſe I have hinted at is already, I ſhall be brief, and ſay that a Miniſter (that is truly made) ought to be choſen by a joynt conſent of the Church, and to be a man of their own coaſt, that is, of the ſame Church, and his gifts tryed and approved: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we never read that there was ever any Miniſter Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or appointed to this or that Church, unleſſe he firſt had been a member with them and Ordained amongſt them, and therefore <hi>Titus</hi> was left in <hi>Crete</hi> to Ordain Elders, If there were found any amongſt them fitly qualified; from whence we may ſee that the true Miniſtery have not ſo large a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe as you travelling Miniſters have, unleſſe is were the Apoſtles, they went from place to place to plant Churches, but not to look for the biggeſt livings, but where the Lord had any work to do they did it, and yet did not bargain before hand what wages they ſhould have for ſo doing, neither did they covet any mans gold or ſilver or the like, but you may ſee more of this in my former Treatiſe intituled, Zions <hi>Redemption, and Original Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, as a true Miniſter muſt be a member of the ſame Church over whom he is appointed, and his gifts approved by them, ſo the ſame Church over whom he is to be a watchman, or to be preſent to hear the charge each over other, when it is ſolemnly given by the Elderſhip, for that end <hi>Titus</hi> was to abide in <hi>Crete</hi> amongſt the Churches, and alſo the Lord commanded <hi>Moſes</hi> to do ſo, concerning <hi>Joſhua,</hi> as you may read in the Book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> ſaying, <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 27.18, 19.</note> 
                  <hi>take thee Joſhua the ſon of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay thy hands upon him, and ſet him before Eliazer the Prieſt and before all the Congregation, and give him a charge in their ſight.</hi> From whence we may ſee that when God hath given any man his Spirit, ſo as to qualifie him for the work of the Miniſtery, and the Church Elected him for the ſame, then (according to the practice of the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> and others alſo) they ought to keep
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118963:80"/>a day ſolemnly unto the Lord by faſting and prayer,
<note place="margin">Act. 3.1, 2, 3.</note> at which time the Elderſhip ought to lay their hands upon the perſon, or perſons (ſo Elected and approved of as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid) and give them their charge in the preſence of all the Congregation, and this is Gods method, and our practice in Ordaining of Miniſters: And again their charge is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to preach the Goſpel inſtant in ſeaſon, and to ſtudy that they may divide the word of truth aright, that their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting may appear to all men that behold them, and ſeveral other thing of this nature, that might be added as matter of their charge but I ſhall paſſe both from this particular, and this ſubject, and come to the vindication of <hi>Zions</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In theſe words we may learn theſe two things: Firſt, the prophets zeal for the Lord, that he doth not onely pray to the Lord to bring judgements upon them,

               <p>Now let the Reader judge whether you underſtood what you printed; for doth this Text imply; that Iſrael ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver return, becauſe the Prophet ſaith, That <hi>HE will love them no more:</hi> But admit the Prophet ſpeaks as in the perſon (as we may ſay) of God; yet the reaſon why he would love them no more, was, becauſe of their ſins; now if they had repented, God could not but have loved them, according to the property of his mercy: Do you not know what is the property of the Attribute of Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy?

                  <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thine help O Iſrael, return to the Lord thy God, for thou haſt faln by thine iniquities, I will heal their back-ſlidings, and love them freely, for mine anger is turned away from him; I will be as the Jew to Iſrael, he ſhall grow as the lillie and caſt forth his roots as Lebanon, his branches ſhall ſpread and his beauty ſhall be as the Olive tree and his ſmell as Lebanon.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that the very ſame Prophet doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of Gods love to Iſrael, and their proſperous eſtate after their return, although you ſay he will love them no more: But whether we may believe you or the Prophet, I leave the Reader to judge (becauſe your ſpeech is oppoſite one to another) and ſo paſſe to the ſecond thing, which is to prove that the Lord is ſo far from retaining, wrath and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Iſrael for ever, that he loveth them with an everlaſting love (<hi>viz.</hi> that people that came from the loins of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>) as will appear from the words of the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Lord hath appeared unto me of old,

<note place="margin">Pſal. 1.2 3, 4.</note> (that is, to a thing that ever was ſo) but if your opinion be true, God compares the godly to a thing that is not, and that in a ſenſe, is to compare them to a lye; but there was and ſhall be trees whoſe leaves fade not, and ſo the godly may fitly be compared to it: I could ſpeak large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this, but I paſſe: and in the ſecond place I ſay, that the Saints may be called a Temple by way of alluſion, becauſe
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118963:85"/>as God did ſhadow out himſelf in the Mercy-ſeat in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of old, and now by his ſpiritual preſence in us, by the which we may (comparatively) be called Gods Temple, yet this doth not deſtroy that which before I have ſaid, that there ſhall be a Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for if it ſhould be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted &amp; ſaid, That <hi>God dwels not in Temples made with hands.</hi>

For as yet I never learned it from the Scriptures: But I ſhall ſhew, that Antichriſt will never own Chriſt in words, or works, and it is a main property in Antichriſt, to deny Chriſt in words as well as in works, as ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>John, Who is a lyar? but he that denieth Jeſus to be the Chriſt;</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I have already proved that HE (<hi>viz.</hi> the Man of ſin) ſpoken of in the <hi>Teſſalonians,</hi> is the Antichriſt, and not (the Woman which ſate upon the ſcarlet coloured Beaſt) <hi>Myſtery Babylon;</hi> and alſo that power or ten horns, that ſhall ſupport Antichriſt, ſhall totally deſtroy the <hi>Pope</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Rome) which is called by the name <hi>Whore,</hi> and after that time, Chriſt and his Army ſhall deſtroy the Man of ſin, and his Army: Now that this is a clear truth, I ſhall ſhew from two plain Texts of Scripture: and firſt to the firſt, that is, that the <hi>Popes</hi> Kingdome ſhall be unterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe that ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, that (ſuch as you have, you put into your book) you erre and know not the Scriptures, or the power of God; cannot he who gives to every ſeed his own body after it is turned to duſt, a thouſand years, raiſe up ſuch by his power without defacing the earth, or putting the earth in an incapacity to bring forth her fruit af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of an earth reſtored? or did you never read that the earth opened her mouth, and ſwallowed up <hi>Korah</hi> and his company, and yet cloſed her mouth again? or hath not he that openeth the earth power to ſhut it again without defacing of it? and did you never read that God took out one of <hi>Adams</hi> ribs,

                  <hi>it was ſo; and as the Scriptures ſpake that a Virgin ſhould conceive, it (alſo) was ſo: and as the Scriptures propheſied of calling his ſon out of Aegypt, it was ſo: and as he was propheſied to ride to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>upon an Aſſes Colt, it was ſo: and as it was propheſied that he and his Diſciples ſhould be for ſigns and wonders in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>it was ſo: and as it was propheſied that the</hi> Jews <hi>ſhould ſmite him on the cheek, it was ſo: and as it was propheſied that they would give him vineger to drink, it was ſo: and as it was propheſied that one ſhould betray him for thirty pieces of ſilver, by which the Potters field ſhould be bought, it was ſo: and as it was propheſied that they ſhould caſt lots for his veſture, it was ſo: and that a bone of him ſhould not be broken, but that he ſhould be peirced, it was ſo done to him.
